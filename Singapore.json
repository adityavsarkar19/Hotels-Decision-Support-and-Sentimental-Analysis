                "review_text": "Thank you Fullerton team for taking care of us. Rafi guided us to wait for check in. It was surprisingly busy but their Q management was superb.   Mira is so sweet. Assisted my partner and I swiftly for check in. She is very detailed and went through our benefits thoroughly.   Our room came with club benefits hence after check in - we proceeded to the club lounge, served by Norish who is polite and graceful. Unfazed by the crowd, the club team did such a good job ensuring that all their guests were taken care off.   My partner and I were also very amazed by Mr Roszel. Firstly we met him at the lobby assisting check in. The next time we saw him at the lounge during evening cocktail, serving guests, making the effort to know all his guests and even took the time to speak to us. We felt really well taken care of.   As for the room - it is meticulously well maintained and of course being a heritage hotel - the decor is old school but that is where the beauty lies. The bed is so comfortable!   My partner and I are very pleased and felt very recharged which is the main purpose of the stay.   Kudos for the Fullerton team (i am sorry i could only name a few) & their passion in their job. Thank you for all that you do and please stay safe!  \u2026",

This place has such a great view and facilities to offer however it wasn\u2019t that which makes me leave the hotel at the end of the stay feeling heavy hearted !! It was the staff !! There are so many small detailing that I have observed that every each one of the staff in this hotel would make sure they do their very best to make sure you feel like home . One of my best favorite was uncle Toh Heng who most of the time under the hot sun making sure everyone gotten their towels and water by the pool yet so smiley :) !! What is unbelievable consistently that I would like the world to know about is our care taker Miss Olivia !! Traveling the world encountered with many care takers there is something very special about this girl that make her stands out from most in the world!! Well Done for keeping the hotel image to the highest level !!  I can also never thank you enough to Ida, Sivan, Kumar and the brassiere team, Ummar, Rhea, Julian, Vanessa, Michelle, Thong, Asenth, 3 boys at the front arrival that I promise to make an extra effort to continue memorizing your names in my future visit , Uncle Toh Heng and another uncle that we met who bring us water and towels in the gym .... All the best to all of you , may god bless you all to be healthy and safe always and you will always be my preferred hotel !!! \u2026",

                "review_text": "My entire 4 stars go towards Warren Naluz Claudia and the Fullerton team, including the Indonesian Lady (Powder Room), all concierge, some men in suits who i presume are from upper management who bothers to greet guests at 9 in the morning. A small exception would be this short hair lady who only greets her specific guests/client/corporate people.  -1 star because the management took it away from the staff. Severely understaffed. Every other component is a 0.  *advise that all guests lower their expectation to avoid disappointment and management to take this review very seriously*  Breakfast: (basically this is where if there was a negative review function i would employ)  I saw a european family basically gagging, im sure your executive board or upper management is definitely made up of some Caucasians, please let them undercover boss the breakfast, they will gag. Waffles taste like kids playdough. Need I say more? Economical fried beehoon disguised as 'wok-fried vermicelli' i give credit to whoever who came up with this, I. clap. for. you. had a  good laugh.   Porridge, i have to quote Gordon Ramsay and say that both the chicken and seafood were rubbery.   Almost everything at breakfast was Not prepared in-house, so so blatantly obvious, in fact I can tell you that the guacamole tastes EXACTLY like Avofresh which can be bought from Coldstorage. Waffles confirm NOT made in-house, dim sum looked colourless, like deadfish, eh no those like food in the display case that has lost its colour from lighting. (go to yi dian xin or imperial treasure,  its like night and day) I dont think you need a customer to teach you that the eyes eat first. Fried chicken that accompanied a few dishes such as the aforementioned vermicelli, taste so stale, like it was made a few days ago.  The only 2 dishes, from the breakfast that purportedly costs/is worth 49$, the laksa and the rice of the nasi lemak(ok fine sambal can eat) were decent, but thats all, coffee very diluted, did i mention that the wait time is like 20-30mins? Ala carte order from staff. They give you some delifrance-esque bread/pastry basket to wait in the meantime.   49$ for entertainment for how disgusting your food is, hmm not even worth it. Basically breakfast was largely inedible.  Tried basically almost(didn't try the muesli) the full breakfast menu but seriously, it was underwhelming.  Check-In: Check-in too about 30mins to 1hr, YES THATS RIGHT. THE FAMILY BESIDE ME WAITED 1 HOUR TO CHECK INTO FULLERTON.  To add injury to insult after waiting to long, they give you a goddam teddybear and expect you to light up or smile or something. Is this a childcare?  Honestly just leave it in the room as a *surprise*  also, most of us have bags to carry, we dont need an additional promotional bear for the moment.  After finding out more, realised it as because they are severely understaffed, don't blame them, blame the upper management/hr , the staff probably has, poor promotion/renumeration. How to retain quality staff???? Also, can try to anticipate if you have a hike in bookings/popular periods right? first day ah? At least courteously inform your guests the day before to expect a long waiting time, minimum right??? or email/all up your guests and offer them maybe a staggered/earlier check time to ease the queue and load on staff? seriously do i need to teach you this radical new concept????? You can ask/remind your guests to do the pre-arrival stuff(book gym/pool) while waiting.  Honestly after learning more from the concierge/general staff, i feel damn bad for the staff. Special shoutout to Warren Naluz, Claudia and entrance(red carpet) staff. I hope all of you get a promotion/pay increase 24month bonus yall deserve it, really top notch service. Top-Notch service from Warren Naluz, hope he is part of the Golden Keys. Please nominate him.  Room: Pass, just basic everything there lor other than that nothing much, can say that they lack attention to detail, disappointing for Fullerton, see attached picture. Don't expect anything unless you book a 4-figure per night room.  Construction work on the 2nd floor lasted for about 1 hr, say goodbye to after-breakfast naps, was staying on the 4th floor. Again, thanks for the entertainment because I thought to myself, WHAT A JOKE FULLERTON. No notice/Letting your guests know, would have been nice? YA?  Pool:  Safety hazard, visited a few times and on ALL occasion, the steps were very wet, if you have elderly/fragile/clumsy/children PLEASE DO NOT RUN. 8am/9am, 12pm/6pm the steps leading towards the pool were dripping wet. Workplace and guest safety issue obvi. Please do not wear the hotel slippers there.  Pros: Bathrobe was good, luxuriously soft material. Near Asian Civilisation museum if you need to dump your kids somewhere.  TLDR: NO Fullerton magic or experience, its basically any other hotel. What a shame because it is such an iconic location and building. SIGH. Please go elsewhere for breakfast. Before they fix these issues I suggest you re-discover sg elsewhere. It isn't something that the CS(Customer Service) team can do/enhance, i think problem lies with management/board/execs.  Learn to balance your international clientele with the local one, form what i can see, you're not trying at all.(except your ground operation staff) hotline staff terrible, say call back but dont call back, any remarks you've left for them to convey are pointless, it is not followed through.\u2026",

We were given into a room (not going to mention the number) which there was a table and 2 chairs outside the window with people looking in. It would be nice if there were like fake plants instead or given to another courtyard room with a little bit of privacy where nobody could stand directly outside the window looking in.   We decided to change our room and we decided why not spend a little more for an upgrade to the marina bay view instead which is so much worth it.

The only positive comments I have about the hotel is the  grand lobby, the generous size of the room and the lush greenery.  Room was not ready when we checked in at 3.00. Only got our key to the room at around 4.15pm.  Unable to give us a late check out to compensate for the delaycheck in.  In my view, this is not the service one expects from a brand like the shangrila.  Room was a bit dated but that\u2019s OK as room was reasonably clean. However the kettle in the room did not switch off by itself. We only discovered the defect when we realised that the kettle had boiled itself dry! Poor QC? Could be a potential safety hazard.

It was definitely much safer by hygiene standards, though the service was slower. Also, they have implemented a booking for usage of the pool which is better to ensure that the number of pax is manageable, though this meant that you may not necc be able to get the pool at your preferred time. overall I enjoyed the experience  and especially the massage! :)",

The poor service started when we tried to book restaurant reservations for lunch and dinner over the 3 days. The hotel staff was adamant over the phone that all restaurants were fully booked despite us having $200 dining vouchers for use. However there were a lot of available slots when I personally went down to the restaurants.  On the first night, I was able to book The Line restaurant and we proceeded to order ala carte. We then waited 1 hour for a simple spaghetti and meatball dish. When asked why it took so long, the waiter informed that a overseas flight landed so they had to prioritize SHN travelers. The reason did not make sense!  After 1hr 15mins, we gave up, told\u2026",

Breakfast at the Line was also great with the usual choices of breakfast regulars. If I may suggest though to include the drinks I.e. coffee and juices in the online menu ordering system as in the third and last day of our stay we decided to eat outdoors instead and it took us sometime to be able to find someone to help us get our coffee and I had to go indoors after sometime and find another someone to request for the same coffee before it finally did arrived.

This is by far the worst stay mainly Because Of the poor hospitality by the frontline check in staff, ZILA. As the first person we met and who attended to our stay,  she was hostile, unfriendly and unreasonable. It is the first time I\u2019ve encountered such frontline staff, from shangri la nonetheless. Could the management seriously look into Zilas conduct as she totally ruined my staycation and this has never happened before for shangri la. Intend to also report her conduct to management too. This is a pity because all the other shangri la staff service was top notch and it\u2019s A Great pity that Zila was the first person we met and unfortunately due to her, totally ruined the staycation experience.",

We are vegetarian and although they had options in the lounge, it was a bit limited and they did not create additional dishes to compensate for this (as they did at the Ritz), which would have been appreciated.

But at shangri la there are lots of activities for the little ones so would strongly recommend to families with young kids. special thanks to haliz, iflah, hyen yen. there was a filipino male staff at buds who was so nice too but i didnt manage to get his name. he was giving me advice on how to change my splashzone resevation due to the rain. my 6 yr old boy enjoyed his stay there. He got to do gingerbread cookies, play at the buds indoor playgrd and the splashzone. My son had such a great time.  My husband felt the room was too dim. I also felt cleanliness was acceptable but could be improved given the high standards of shangrila.\u2026",

The Pacific Club, served by Jayrick, Angel, Evan and Tanya was equally excellent. The team\u2019s service was impeccable and we thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon tea and dinner cocktails, surveying the panoramic view at Level 38. Will be back again! ",

The 19th floor room also gave a good view of the cityscape.  The gentleman on duty at the poolside bar on the afternoon of 14 March was also friendly and professional.

Many thanks to Quam for his meticulous and humble hospitality service.

This year was much quieter, as lions dance and dragon dance were not allowed.  However, it was still a good stay.  Everything was so familiar, since we have already stayed here several times.  We were given a room overlooking the Orchard Road, and a full view of the swimming pool.  So it was a nice room with good view.  Room was spacious enough for an extra bed.  Although the room was not very big, it was cosy.  Breakfast was served at Orchard Cafe.  There were only 4 or 5 main set we can order for breakfast, besides the beverages, cereals etc.  The western set was better, as compared to the Oriental set where the portion was not so much.

She still can ask me wanna change new bedsheets or not... really kind of extra foolish question. As she changes it after my answer is Yes. After all its my 1st time to choose staying this hotel. For such simple mistake. it's really gave me kind of feeling I won't want to recommend my contacts to consider choosing this hotel for rooms check-in.

Equipped with a highly updated sound and lighting system, coupled with 2 huge LED screens, the ballroom is set to be a dream venue for any couple out there.  But the most important feature which actually made our wedding experience an unforgettable one was the staff of Orchard hotel. From day one of the ballroom viewing, to the food tasting and the wedding day itself and at checkout, Haze and Mun Kiat who were the sales and operations personnel attached to us, ensured that our every need is attended to. No stone was left unturned. They, together with the banquet staff during the wedding reception really bend (bent?) their back backwards\u2026",

Thankfully, the clubs are not open due to COVID, otherwise, we think there will be a bit of noise on a Friday night.  Room is comfortable and clean. It looks newly renovated and modern. TV had lots of channels.   Breakfast - you choose the cuisine that you want. The portion is huge so never mind that it wasn't a buffet. Other tables had quite a lot of leftover food, which is a shame as all these will go to\u2026",

The photo in Agoda website showing a sofa but ended up just a cushion chair, didn't wanna make a fuss of it as only a night stay. Wardrobe is dusty under the interior light. The management need to improve the flushing system of the toilet bowl, need multiple flushings to clear the waste fully. Handheld shower was dislodged thus water flushing out at the joint when i turn it on. Am surprised that housekeeping staff did not discover that. I managed to fix that myself so i can use it. My room has a japanese style square bathtub that i did not expect to have.  Check-in was smooth at 1.30pm and counter staff was helpful. Breakfast was average.",

I wasn\u2019t too well adjusted to the climate flying in from Hawaii,\u2026",

Queue was pretty long at check-in but i was glad that there were 6 staff handling the process and beverages were offered to guests in the queue.  Fitness Centre was chic. Love the concept. The machines were among the latest, very user friendly.   Room was chic. Quite modern and pleasing to the eyes. The closet and minibar very nicely hidden. The shower cubicle was a bit too small. It fits 1 person. Bathtub was pretty shallow but was good. There is a water dispenser beside the tap. Great idea but.. you can't fill up your bottle or the one provided in the room because, the dispenser was short. You can use the glasses provided on top of the minibar.  The coffee table in the room was nice. However, the chair was super uncomfortable. There is no work or business table / chair so the same chair had to be carried to the TV console to do work. Very uncomfortable. I am short at 1.63m in height and i guess someone taller might be in a worse state.  Air-con was great. Can be controlled and stayed at the desired climate.  Wifi was good.  The power plug by the bed was not working. The power from the USB port at the same point was pretty slow. I waa lucky that i brought my travel charger and charged my mobile at the tv console area.  Balcony was great by no shelter so it does get wet when it rained.  TV channels were... so-so. I was quite surprised at the number of channels. Not impressed.  I looked through the in-room dining as i wanted to get some cakes. No desserts in the menu.  Overall, i thought more could have been expected for the price the hotel charges. I get more for the same price at a nearby premise.  \u2026",

Firstly, the stay at the hotel and secondly, the wedding experience.  -Stay at Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay- The hotel is newly renovated at our time of visit. The urban rooms were nice and cosy and we had an unblocked view of MBS. The amenities provided in the room was sufficient and most of the housekeeping/ room service requests can be done via a QR Code by the bedside.   The bridal suite was equally good and equipped with 2 bathrooms, one in the main bedroom (with bathtub) and another in the living room area (no bathtub). Only feedback is that the wardrobe is too small for the amount of attires we had (3x wedding dress + 1 gua). Sunlight was good for make up.

They make sure you are well settled in and comfortable during your stay.  The location is good as is near many amenities like food and shopping and public transport.",

There were still a number of renovations being done in the hotel during our stay but it didn't affect us at all.  We had lunch both at the peach \ud83c\udf51 blossom and peppermint restaurants.   Room stay was comfortable and staff were friendly.   Want to give our thanks to Cha from the front desk, Mogan from belldesk, Daniel and Nobel from Peach Blossoms, Stewart and Sarina from Peppermint. Not forgetting staff from one connect. Many thanks for your friendly voices. We shall be back!   For overseas future travellers, there's loads to shop from across, beside the hotel. Loads of food eateries around the area too. You just need to explore.   Recommended!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

If you are not sensitive to those, then go ahead to book your staycation now with its current low rates.   We did request for a change of room and the noise did subside. The design of the lobby garden in the hotel\u2019 is beautiful with real chirping birds and the sculpture of wind chimes waves hanging at the lobby as a feature is indeed charming. But again if you are sensitive to noise, then you maybe disturbed by it as the birds sing as early as 8am.....Or charmed by it by waking you up gently...Combined with the lobby music, it tend to become quite loud. Not for everyone but it is certainly unique. I am told the pool is a mineral pool but\u2026",

Customer service was great, reception was welcoming and friendly. She addressed my requests that I had on my reservation and explained most of the things well. Restaurant staff at breakfast was also friendly. Tv was big and great. QR codes and chatbot for booking of facilities was easy to use. Loved the filtered water tap.

The stay was absolutely lovely. Room is fresh-smelling and clean, and love the non-carpeted floor now as it seems much cleaner than carpets. Room is well equipped with all the necessary amenities, if you need extra items (and to book pool/gym slots) you will just need to scan the QR code on the night stand.

When we reached our room, we are in awe of the room's ambiance and the view in the balcony is magnificent! The room is very clean and smells nice as well. Few minutes after we reached our room, the room services knocked to deliver our extra mattress. When I examine the room I found this awesome toilet. It's very huge! We just noticed one thing, the downside is, there is no bidet present in the toilet so it's quiet hard to you know, wash after you use the toilet. I hope the management would consider adding bidet inside the toilets considering it is a must and also the hotel is a 5 star hotel without bidet. Nevertheless, we had a great dinner at Lavo, The staff there are very approachable. In the morning we did a morning exercise in the gym. The gym equipment are high-end. After we hit the gym, we planned to go for a swim but it is quiet hard to make a reservation for the pool so we had to wait for a while and wish for our luck to get a slot for the pool. Sad thing is, we can only use the pool for an hour. By the way, there is a store beside the pool and I would like to commend Ms. Lina for assisting us in buying our stuffs. She is very approachable and hands on to guests.

But they are really accommodating on our requests and orders.   Overall, the stay was great. I would definitely come back for a stay again. Hopefully soon!!!! \ud83d\ude06\u2026",

Worse is denied having rooms at the same floor. So whats the point of having a stayca when rooms were so far away. Explanation given were MBS rules for COVID Prevention. Do not understnad why total of 5 people allowed in 1 room but having room at the same floor not allowed. Worse is Manager Kenny did not gave a professional explanation but blamed it in the MBS regulation. MBS really need to review their rules in allocating room.

They have strict number of guest come and go into the tower. They count it in front of the lift entrance. So bear in mind to give ample time as it can be quite a queue on busy hours. As far my staycation journey goes, this is the only hotel that does it.  The pool is limited to 1 hour and very hard to get slot. Make sure to book early. ",

Special thanks to one of the housekeeping staff Xi Mei.  I appreciate her initiative of placing  a kiddie slipper and a small towel for my child  when we returned to our room without us requesting for it.

                "review_text": "I was looking forward to this staycation in this heritage 5* hotel, and booked a Junior Suite for myself, my husband and our son.  However, the experience didn't live up to the price and the expectations one has for a luxury hotel.  The hotel suffers from a dated set of facilities, some extremely peculiar recent interior design decisions, patchy service and questionable cleanliness.  Whilst all of these things might be acceptable for a 3* or 4* establishment, they're not when you're paying the kind of prices Goodwood Park charges.  Being in a lovely heritage building, you'd expect some old-world charm to the hotel, and the building exterior is very pretty. But, heritage of one thing. Dated and old-fashioned is another.  The Main Pool is very antiquated, and a bit forlorn looking.  A few sun loungers are scattered around in long, unkempt grass which surrounds the pool, flanked by tired and shabby paving. The child's pool at the end is particularly neglected, and the discoloured tiles make it look like the water is dirty.  The smaller Mayfair Pool is much prettier, and very pleasant. However, both pools lack facilities. There's no changing rooms in either, nor any toilets. To access a toilet, you either have to go all the way back to your room, or to walk through the restaurant or lobby to use the restaurant toilets. It's a very odd set-up and rather off-putting.    But the rooms are what is most baffling about this hotel. We booked a suite, and had high hopes, especially since the website states that they were all refurbished last year.  However, its clear this was done on a very tight budget. The living area is spartan and lacking.  Bizarrely, despite being a large room, there's no sofa, only a strange kind of low bench, and a very uncomfortable vinyl coated armchair.  There's no separation between the living area and the bedroom, which makes it unsuitable for families with an older child.  The bathroom is frankly perplexing, and not up to the standard you expect for a 5* suite. It is large, and could have easily accommodated a bathtub and a walk-in shower.  Instead there's a pokey budget bath/shower combo with a cheap-looking sliding door, that you have to climb into to use.  Towels are stored on the wall behind the sliding door, so you have to climb into the bath to access them.  This is a space-saving solution that you see in small budget hotels, or in HDBs, and in those locations it makes sense.  But having a Travelodge-style bathroom in a 5* suite is very jarring.  Despite having plenty of space for a double vanity, which is standard in a master bathroom in a suite, there's one small sink that everyone has to share.  For some reason there's also floor to ceiling storage units on both sides of the tiny sink area, which are empty. These would be very helpful in our HDB at home, but are completely useless in a hotel room, where guests are normally staying for only a couple of nights.  We would have overlooked these points if everything else was high quality, but even basic cleanliness was an issue.  The rooms were serviced, but there was poor standards on show, with dirty dishes left in the room after servicing. The corridors are strewn with rubbish and dirty dishes discarded from the hotel's guests, that sit in the corridors for hours, without being cleared.  Housekeeping is clearly not a high priority.  In terms of F&B, there are three restaurants open during the evening. The Sichuan Min Jiang, specialises in shark fin, so if you care about conservation and sustainability, please steer clear. Another is the Coffee Lounge, a basic cafeteria that specialises in durian and has all the olfactory qualities you'd expect from that. The smell is very intense and permeates the whole area around the cafeteria, so you'd need to be a big fan of durian to brave that one.  The last one, Gordon Grill, has a limited menu which looks like something you would have found in a faux-French restaurant in a quaint English town in the 1970s.    We wouldn't worry about a lot of these things in a budget hotel, like an Ibis or a Travelodge, but if you're paying over $600 a night, we did expect better.    Overall the impression is of a hotel that is dated, tired and old-fashioned, not a a luxury heritage establishment.  I wouldn't stay here again.\u2026",

This wonderful hotel is located close to the junction of Scotts Road and Orchard Road very close to the shops. A  traditional colonial style low rise property the rooms are extremely comfortable and the two pools ideal for a dip after a long flight. The breakfasts are delicious and taken in a beautiful room at the front of the building.The Goodwood  has a long and illustrious history. Many of the staff have worked here for over 40 years. They are very knowledgeable and incredibly helpful. The service was excellent and room which overlooked one of the pools well appointed and very large. One of the best hotels I have stayed in for a long time.",

We have tried other hotels in Singapore  but return here.It is not the cheapest place to stay but a great place to relax  and unwind after a journey. The hotel is set in lovely grounds and not being high rise makes for a more relaxing ambience. The hotel grounds are well maintained , rooms are spacious and clean and well appointed. Staff are lovely , and efficient.  Location is about 200 yards from Orchard road which is very busy with many malls and food outlets close to an MTR .Good bus links too. Walking distance to Botanic Gardens if you are fit. ",

Most tables were reserved (as for reason it is a favourite for tea with people) but we were sat at one that was not waiting for our cake order to arrive. We were so rudely moved out of it by a waiter who told us it, too, was reserved. When I pointed there was no sign, he said that a sign on an adjacent table applied to this table as well!!!

It was my daughter's 21st and staff took note of that and sent birthday greetings. The hotel also upgraded her room and delivered a cake to her room. We were pleasantly surprised by the thoughtful gestures. Not many hotel establishment do that these days. This little effort of going the extra mile for their guest has made my daughter feel valued and special. We are very appreciative of this gesture. Will return again even though we live in Singapore!

As we had stayed there when we first arrived in the city (back then not-yet-married and without kids), we were looking forward to coming full circle on our time in the little red dot.  The hotel is indeed very nice, with spacious rooms and a beautiful Laguna-like Swimming pool. But what really sets it apart are their staff!! We booked online, but upon hearing our story we nonetheless received an upgrade to a suite (without having even asked for it)! The suite does have direct access to one of the pools, was tastefully furnished, full of light, and very nice. Needless to say, we were very thankful and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Any\u2026",

We had a pleasant night with comfy mattress and sheets. The rooms were clean and looked so instagram-able. The layout is simple yet has a hint of elegance.  Kudos to the Housekeeping Team  Park Hotel Alexandra as simple as the name sound is well on its way to being a top notch flagship in the hospitality industry, with its well trained staff  Kudos to the General Manager and team for maintaining and training up\u2026",

The pool area was also pretty. Loved those pillars around the pool. I think they are Roman inspired. Really contributes to the aesthetics of the place.  However, not everything was perfect about the stay. The most glaring negative was the breakfast. Each guest was entitled to only one set. Absolutely no refills apart from drinks were allowed. This came as a surprise to me. There wasn\u2019t even a break basket, fruit or yoghurt. The egg set I had was miserable looking. To\u2026",

The garden tour was worse - we received a confirmation call at about 10+am confirming the tour scheduled for 11.30am and to meet at level 5. We reached before 11.30am and waited till 11.45am. There was no staff deployed to conduct the tour. There was an ROM ceremony and when my husband tried to enter the garden next to where the ROM ceremony was held to check if there was any staff conduct the tour, he was abruptly stopped by a not so polite staff who told him to wait till the ceremony was over.

The fantastic location of the hotel. However, I had a very strange experience with the One Connect service person on duty on 27Mar (Sat) around 4pm. I called to inform that I do not need housekeeping for my 3 day stay. I was told, please call back tomorrow as she has no way to notify. I was like \u2018fine, then can I have r extra towels\u2019? The operator asked \u2018how many?\u2019. I said 3. She said \u2018how many people is staying in the room?\u2019. Me \u20182\u2019. She replied \u2018hmm... you need that many??\u2019. Me \u2018well, it\u2019s for 3 days and I do not want housekeeping and there\u2019s only 2 towels in the room now\u2019. I didn\u2019t see a need to explain that my wife and I run every morning so we take more showers then the usual hotel guest. Because why do I need to? Should she just respond with \u2018sure, I will arrange that and is there anything I can help you with?\u2019 I don\u2019t believe this is due to lack of training . It\u2019s an attitude problem. This operator must be too lazy to do her job , or she is probably serving her last day of resignation notice. Still, one bad employee didn\u2019t spoil the good work of the others. This is still a very good stay part from this truly unique experience I had with this One Connect operator .\u2026",

Loved the interior design of the signature king room. so many windows and mirrors make the room so bright and pleasant to stay in. Room was sparkly clean as well.  Special shout out to Chin at the reception who was so heart warming and helpful throughout my stay there! I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Singapore to stay at Parkroyal Pickering!",

It's only school holidays and not even or a PH and the service sucks! And well saying goodbye to a $200+ for being MIA  eventhough  we are physically there. \"GOOD JOB\" management! Wake up man!",

I booked your hotel is because of this late 4pm check out.  I spoked to your staff kelly shum regarding this issue during my check in, she said that she will get back to me on my late check out, but she didn't. As such this hotel have a way of writing and saying things without honouring.  I still have to call the front desk, to enquire about my own check out timing. What is this kind of service?

One room was complimentary as part of the Healthcare HERO program while we paid for an additional room.  My advise to families with young children  1. Avoid these rooms as they located along a narrow corridor with short metal poles along it (see photo). This can be dangerous for children who may try to climb over the poles.  2. The condition of room 915 was poor (see photo on bathtub and washbasin). The washbasin has multiple brownish stains and looks disgusting. This was highlighted for the duty manager who eventually came back to confirm that it\u2019s a permanent stain. That\u2019s it - no offer to change room or what so ever -\u2026",

When I asked to move my family of 4 to a larger and comfy window seat, the staff Vita just brushed aside my request by merging tables as breakfast was arriving (less work for them I reckon), leaving me a fantastic view of their black-tiled dull and barren kitchen.   And don't bother asking for a latte. You have to pay more for that. Breakfast time is restricted to 1.5hours so forget about stretching that buffet appetite. I'll be having breakfast elsewhere tomorrow instead. You can get a much better meal at the mall next door for under $6.   Don't get me\u2026",

Was checked in by Jacqueline and she breezed thru my registration and even chatted with my kids. I can see other front desk staff smiling and accommodating to the guests despite the long queue!  Was given a room on the 17th floor with a great view of the city. Room was very comfortable. I had no issues with the WIFI and aircon was good and strong. Kids loved the bathtub and this compensated when we did not get slots for the swimming pool.  Breakfast was included in our room rate and we gave it a try the next day. Due to safety measures, no buffet breakfast here. Guest orders were taken, food were served and drinks were refilled. Guests did not need to leave the seats! All were well taken care of! Lyn served us for both days and she remembered our orders the next day. Kudos to her! Ryan also was helpful getting my kids refills (kids being kids).  So a big THANK YOU to Carlton Hotel Bras Basah for making the March Holidays enjoyable! Especially to my kids!

Everything was fine until we chanced upon the head of security and the 2nd-in-charge.Both of them are malays and they wear dark suits.   Not only were they very rude, they performed their duties as though they were gangsters running a place. Moreover, we caught them smoking and making fun of guests in the middle of the night. Absolutely no respect for anyone because they are security hooligans.   Good luck to you if you ever meet them. I have no idea what they are capable of doing. Their presence makes my female and young relatives shiver.   We decided never to return ever again because of them.",

The Premier Club lounge has a great view and offers a much more relaxed breakfast option and the evening happy hour includes drinks and snacks. Alcohol is quite pricey in Singapore so if you like a glass or two of wine in the evening, this is great.   The staff in the lounge were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and while we were hopeful, we didnt expect to be in our room until later in the day. So we were surprised and grateful when we were first encouraged to have breakfast in the Premier Lounge while we waited for our room and then, while at breakfast, were told\u2026",

It is a new hospitality concept designed to meet the evolving needs of today\u2019s E-generation traveler.  We arrived very early in the morning, with the intention to leave our bags at the concierge and head off to Pulau Ubin. We were greeted by Mas, a very friendly concierge staff. After taking our temperature, we headed to the check-in counter. We met Fherzana, a very amiable and customer-centric staff. The usual check-in is at 4pm but Zana said she would try her best to arrange at 2pm. Then she went through the different hotel facilities and explained to us booking would be required due to Covid-19. She took the initiative to check with us and arranged a slot for the pool, steam room etc, as she told us the bookings usually run out fast. In the midst of all these, she told us that she would upgrade our rooms to deluxe studios, as the rooms we have booked were not available. And all these were done quite swiftly.   When we returned around 130pm, we were surprised that one of our rooms was ready to check-in. Zana told us she will try to get ready the other room, which was ready around 230pm.   As you can see from the photos, the room is spacious. There is a small kitchenette area to do simple cooking. And guess what we did for breakfast? My next post!  I loved the selection of the toiletries. The bed linen was soft and the pillow firmness was just right for me.   There is a good size gym which I didn\u2019t get to use it. The swimming pool water was warm, I think it was due to the warm weather that day. The sauna and steam room were good and clean. There is a \u201cspin & play\u201c room on every floor, where you could do your laundry and enjoy some games like Kinect for #xbox360 or a good massage by #ogawa massage chair.   During our checkout, we were again greeted by Zana and Mas. where Zana came to where we were seated and just to ensure our stay was good. We praised her for her professionalism.   Capri is a perfect getaway to rekindle the special connection with your partner and friends, or just wanting to have the \u201cme time\u201d vacation.\u2026",

The recipe is pretty easy to follow, just that it can be improved by labelling the containers of each ingredient to avoid confusion.

They did not take the initiative to inform us on the new procedure of not providing complimentary tickets. When questioned about the recent change, they were dismissive and just defensive claiming that it is not on them since it has been featured on the booking website. They then just referred our case to the manager, who happened to be nice and apologetic but by then, emotions were high and the damage is done. We also had to be charged for a parking fee of 20-odd dollars which could have been avoided if they had notified us upon checking in. Moving forth, the check in time was also an issue for us.

Further than that, I found short hair on the fresh towel on the first night (I have very long hair which clearly isn't mine).  I didn't report to the hotel right away because it was late, and I waited the next morning which I found another hair stuck on the shower bottle, and it looked like it has been there for a while because the water wouldn't wash it away. I told the manager I'd like to check out right away, and requested for the refund of remaining nights but got refused.  Overall, horrible services and sanitation.",

Many thanks to the hotel to accommodate our request for adjoining rooms, the early check-in, and the birthday surprise delivered by Yolanda.  Many thanks also to Eswari and Aldrina for the patience shown in clarifying the parking charges. S$21.40 for a single-use exit pass regardless of the number of hours/days stayed.   The location of this hotel is very good. There are many big shopping malls and food establishments right beside it. The MRT is very nearby too.   The room layout is somewhat unconventional with the bathroom located right against the exterior windows. This means guests have to choose between privacy or good view and natural light.  It also means lots of curtains up/down. It will take some getting used to by some.  Our family has enjoyed our staycation with this hotel. Despite the abovementioned layout, the rooms are very cozy.   The Komyuniti Restaurant located at Level 10 is a good place to dine in also. It is doing relatively well despite the many Covid-19 restrictions in place. Their prices are reasonable. \u2026",

We stayed here for 2 days and 1 night (checked in on 23/03 and checked out on 24/03). The rooms are beautiful, cozy and neat and the location of this property are conveniently accessible for transportation, shopping and for looking for food places. Also, their lift lobby are lit with the neon lights which are so pretty and the hallway suits the scene for filming a horror movie. Highly recommend this property and will be back there someday!",

We used the mission-control (manned counter) to check in, and pay an additional top up for the overnight parking which came up to be $21.40.  After checking in, we went to the 10th floor to book the time slot for the swimming pool. The pool is quite small, and with children playing in it, you have to watch where you swim.

Despite room size is small, everything in the room is neat and tidy.  Given a nice city view in the toilet but don't forget to bring down the bind before you do your business. Room door is thick thus i did not hear any noise from the hotel corridor. Nice smart bed that you can adjust the angle while watching TV on bed. Water pressure from shower head is good but the only issue i have is the glass toilet door. If you are staying with another person you be able to see him/her sitting on toilet bowl, as the toilet door cannot be closed fully. There are gym and swimming pool at Level 10 but did not book any slot to try them.  Did not opt for breakfast\u2026",

Hence , the blinds had to be wind up and down before and after usage of the bathroom. The sink is right next to the bed , might not be the best if you are not staying alone and your partner is a light sleeper. There is no proper table or space to be used to sit down and have a meal together in the room. Breakfast is average but still decent , with savoury and sweet options offered.

Check in time is 3pm but I reached the hotel at 11am and planned to leave my bags there with the concierge first as  we had some brunch plans and planned to come back at 3pm. However the Receptionist, (Vanessa I think? Guest Service Supervisor.) allowed me a complimentary early check in, which was kind of her!  When we first stepped into the room, we were impressed by the cleanliness of the room! Except for a bit of tape that was left on a really high part of the wall (I guess the previous guest pasted some decorations for a party or celebration?) which would have been hard to notice anyway, everything else was thoroughly clean and you could tell the room furniture and appliances were well-maintained too! Room was prepared by Housekeeping staff named Leong. Although we didn\u2019t get to meet him, he definitely left a great impression to us. The Housekeeping team must be proud to have him in their team!  The Concierge Team were always helpful and friendly! Glenn helped with our luggage upon our departure, he was cheerful and pleasant. There was another Concierge staff, I didn\u2019t manage to get his name, but he was an Indian man, who was also very friendly to all the guests! You can tell he was well-liked by the residents too because I noticed they were all happy to see him every morning. The receptionist who attended to me at check out (Mikaela, I think?) from the Reception team was also very pleasant and full of smiles.   Room was spacious! Beds were comfortable and I love that the bathroom had both ceiling rain shower and a freestanding tub! I normally don\u2019t bother to get into bathtubs in hotels but I couldn\u2019t say no to soaking and relaxing in a nice deep freestanding tub.   Breakfast was not that impressive but that didn\u2019t dampen our stay. Definitely had an enjoyable staycation and I foresee my husband and I returning to Ascott Orchard for future staycations!  \u2026",

There is a reply email stating that my request is taken notice but it depends on availability. It is not last min booking. But the floor I am assigned is level 4 on the gym & swimming pool facilities level, right outside the gym (first room) The serviced apartment is 20-floors. Worse the room is dusty & the door is not sound proof. I can hear children giggling & running outside my door. Along the corridor there is a staff sitting outside the elevator which is a turn off experience for a \"luxury stay\"... My second room is worse so near to the staff who is sitting near the elevator.  The dust in the room is not acceptable too. The fabric\u2026",

Given the sky high prices, we had huge expectations of the food. $30 for a plate of ok nasi goreng or a bowl of terrible wanton noodles is just ridiculous. Even the world famous chicken rice that came with hainanese pork chop was soggy & not fragrant.Xx",

Two MRT stations close by which makes it convenient if you want to use the MRT or Grab. I booked 2 x deluxe rooms for 4 days.  I gave the room a 3 star as there was no power sockets at the bed side tables. This means we had to use the spare gpo at the work desk and also unplug the lamp sitting on the work desk. Also, where the kettle is positioned, the cable length of the kettle doesn't reach the gpo provided near the floor. We had to move the kettle to the work desk and use the gpo there. Suggest the hotel provides a power board to charge electronic devices.   Apart from the gpo, the room was perfect :-)",

So is Lloyd\u2019s Inn really what you have seen and read? Let me share some of my personal experiences.   Lloyd\u2019s Inn Singapore is not like any other big hotels. It has her charms - a mixture of quaint and modern minimalist contemporary design. It is also known as a boutique hotel, with an oasis in mind in the city\u2019s center.   As you entered the main entrance, you would walk across an elevated bridge, with a bird\u2019s eye view to the surrounding common areas - a small square size garden with swings, a very narrow dipping pool, and some shaded nooks and crannies where one could relax and read - before reaching the hotel lobby.   Lloyd\u2019s Inn has different types of rooms available. I opted for the \u201cgarden room\u201d which was a tier above the standard room because of the beautiful photos displayed on their website. When I entered the room which was on the ground level, the room was a bit smaller, which was expected. I was eagerly looking for the swing in the garden, where I could take some #instagramable photos, but to my dismay, the garden was just a tiny small patch of space. My inspiration to take beautiful photos was completely destroyed. However I loved the bathroom (which was not really well taken, as you could see from photo#6 due to the disappointment), it was partially indoors with an open outdoor concept, giving you some privacy and closed to nature.   I felt a bit \u201ccheated\u201d with the fact that I have paid a bit higher to get the type of room I wanted. So I decided to go to the concierge to check with the staff. The staff were friendly but not too professional. I explained to one of them, telling him the room configuration was not the same as in their website, and all he said was \u201cI am sorry because the room has been taken\u201d, cos there is only 1 such room. Why did Lloyd\u2019s Inn put that photo in their website if there is only 1 room? Or at least to state clearly in the website that there is only 1 such room! I returned to the room frustrated.   Another disappointment: I indicated that I would like to have a queen size bed during my booking. My bed looked like one but I realized it was joined together from 2 single beds. Come on! This is not a budget hotel! With the premium price that I have paid, I could not even get a decent queen size bed? To add salt to the wounds, during check-in, the staff at the concierge reiterated my request during the check in. If she would tell me that the bed I would be getting were 2 joined-single beds, at least my heart was prepared. The whole experience really spoilt my dream #staycationsg   Talking about #customercentricity and #transparency these days... #lloydsinnsingapore has much to learn.   Well I was determined not to be spoilt by these experiences. So I explored around the area for eateries \ud83c\udf72 \ud83c\udf71 \ud83e\udd58.   Indeed one is spoilt with choices - from local coffee shops to restaurants, a wide selection! Whether it\u2019s comfort food from Killiney Kopitiam, or Hong Kong Tim Sum by So Good Char Chang Ting, there will definitely one that will suit you. Other choices will be like Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Western etc. Look out for my food reviews to some of these places I have visited next week.   Lloyd\u2019s Inn comes with a simple breakfast set, in collaboration with ABC, Artisan Boulangerie Co. as they don\u2019t have a kitchen or restaurant in the hotel. They do have an outdoor seating areas where you can #grabfoodsg and enjoy the alfresco dining.   Overall, a very unique experience. Would I be back again? Hmmmf, I would think twice with the same amount for a hotel that know how to appreciate their guests. \u2026",

I am glad I booked a garden room as it\u2019s bigger and has outdoor space - something like a balcony if you would like. The shower also is under the canopy of trees. If you like exclusivity, greenery and quaintness this inn will serve you well. I feel it\u2019s more for couples and solo travellers, not so good for the family. First and foremost there\u2019s no proper swimming pool, just a wading pool and the lack of dining facilities onsite is a killer. Breakfast vouchers are giving to go to a nearby cafe for a hot drink and a pastry. But my main qualm is there\u2019s no sound proofing system. I was awakened on both nights, first day by people showering, second day by the heavy rain. So, if you are looking for a good sleep you may want to consider this. Other than that, the hotel room is clean and I like the minimalist concept and concrete floor. Not much to complain of. \u2026",

The outdoor bathtub is really nice for a night soak and i love that the tub was very clean as well. We had a wonderful night's sleep, and the room was also spacious and clean. Soundproofing is not the best as we can hear what's going on outside the door but that did not really bother us as it wasn't too noisy. Location is a definite plus as we could easily walk to Orchard Road and back, with lots of entertainment and food options around.",

The hotel itself is well located close to Orchard Rd and public transport options, the service was good and the pool area is nice.  But the room we had was slightly damp and not as clean as I would have expected it to be (we found dust, ants and hair between the twin beds), given the image that Lloyd's Inn portrays of being minimalist but good quality. I had higher expectations of this balance between minimalism and quality.  If they had charged slightly less (we paid approx. SGD200 per night for a twin garden room), I wouldn't have minded my experience. As a comparison, there are other hotels in Singapore that are of a similar level of quality (or better) that charge less per night. So I was slightly disappointed that\u2026",

The free breakfast of a coffee and pastry at ABC co was enjoyable - the pastry was very yummy, however could have been more substantial.

No long snake queues, everyone was being served as quickly as possible. Immediate check in, no need to wait. Albeit they can be seen being short staffed, but they indeed worked hand in hand smoothly. We also got a complimentary room upgrade.   I had requested a baby cot and Mr Azri I immediately get his housekeeper to send them to my room.   Room was clean, no cockroaches or insects, there\u2019s a bath tub too, and tell you, the breakfast is to die for. Don\u2019t miss it! Floor\u2026",

However, due to the hotel being used for SHN instead, we were given a choice of going for the Nuve heritage or Park Royal pickering. We chose this hotel because of location. The room was fine. However, i would think an upgrading of the room is necessary. Room was a suite at level 6 and was the only room at that level.  The artist suite is the only room with an outdoor balcony. Which was nice. However, toilet tiles were stained yellow. Under the bed, there were a couple of used tissues when we entered. I would think during this covid era, proper housekeeping is highly important.   Electric kettle was dirty with obvious brown stains inside. And the dolce gusto machine, water compartment was yellow and pretty stained. It was rectified when we came back thanks to Joel quick response.  After our first night, housekeeping came and did the basic clean up. But a little confused on why a pile of towels were left behind instead of being cleared away.   Apart from all this little areas that needs improvement, the only thing that deserves a mention is Joel. He checked us in swiftly and was very patient in listening and attending to our needs.

However, the staff were helpful and tried to solve it by changing the batteries. This did not solve the problem though. I think there is a sensor problem since it seems to work when we closed the toilet lid. That was a bit of a downer as we were excited to use it. The room was generally clean but there were quite a lot of ants whenever we had some coffee or snacks in the room. Room was generally quiet except for some car horn sounds along Prinsep. I would like to commend Joel for his attentiveness during our stay such as helping to keep our cake in the restaurant fridge and even answering all my queries promptly prior to the visit.   What really ruined my whole experience was at the check-out. I was asked to pay for a towel that had yellow stains by a female staff at the front desk. Since I had not seen that stain in my stay, I asked the staff about where it was and what it was stained by. The lady staff on-duty replied very condescendingly. I kept telling her I did not see that stain in any of the towels I used and she kept saying all the towels provided in the rooms were unstained so if it is stained it must be from our use.  I asked to look at where the towel was found and the staff brought me back to the room. I was told that the towel was found in a pile on the floor at the foot of the bed between the bed and night stand. My partner recalled using that towel the night before for a bath and it did not look stained. (None of the bath robes or other towels we used got stained so I do not think it was due to any of our bath products as well) It was still wet when he put it on the floor and I think it might have gotten stained from some dirt on the floor/ bottom of the bed or nightstand since it was still wet.   However, I was given no grace from this staff. In the end she did not charge me the extra charges but kept saying how she had the right to charge me and she was doing me this huge favor. I felt extremely disrespected by her attitude. Considering I also saw blood stains on the bedsheet but thought it was a minor issue and did not raise it up, I don't know why the staff are not able to provide some grace and magnanimity in this situation.\u2026",

Got a message from the hotel right after booking at their website that if i book online, i could get early check-in &/or late check-out (subject to approval) for an hour. Checked with front desk when check-in & when he check on his end, he said that we could prolly extend for an hour but he ask us to call in front desk tomorrow instead to check again. When we called in the morning, called the front desk & a lady answer. Funny thing is after we ask her for a late check-out for an hour, she say that an hour cost $50. Then i was like but your website says we could get an extra hour check-out. So i check with her again about the complimentary 1 hour check-out, then she says in a rude tone with a disgusting attitude, if we want the complimentary late\u2026",

FREE minibar was a nice touch, breakfast across the road ok, and really friendly staff.   We have marked this as a 5 out of 5 because of location, bed, clean room, and staff.  Tips. Make sure you book direct as they have some great deals available. When in Singapore, you must visit the Orchid Gardens and Botanic Gardens. We use the Big Bus Tour which was convenient.

It isn't too near from the MRT stations, around 8 minutes walk to be exact from Bugis or City Hall stations. There are many eateries along the way though and there are shopping districts around. Hence, it's quite strategic.  - Free mini-bar. From Dolce Gusto capsules to soft drink, beer and snacks. They replenish daily. My favourite perk.  - Comfortable bed and clean house keeping. I got a few good night sleeps there.  - There is a cafe attached to it. Didn't try it though but it looks cozy and comfortable.  Cons: - Room space is a little bit small, compared to the rooms I stayed in other countries with the same price around Asia. Deluxe King\u2026",

I couldn't believe that when I told the manager (Mark) he was very blase about it and his response was to say that previously children of up to 4 years of age had been in the cot without issue.

Good points-good location, complimentary snacks in the room Bad points-the WiFi is horrendous, unless you\u2019re sat downstairs right in reception by the router you won\u2019t be able to use the internet full stop. The breakfast is shocking-basic is one thing but when they can only offer toast, cold scrambled eggs and garlic (yes garlic!) mushrooms, and a tiny bowl of yoghurt and a few pieces of fruit for the whole hotel it\u2019s a poor show!

However, the experience this time was not so enjoyable. The plusses were that the front staff were courteous and professional during check in, the hotel itself was quiet with strong wifi for working, and the breakfast was very filling and delicious. However, not all the perks listed on the package were given, such as the morning and midday snacks. The fresh juices were nice, though.  I encountered very mixed service at Ginett  restaurant where I tried to use the lunch and drink voucher given as part of the package.

For late night owls, there's a open air Thai restaurant just downstairs of the hotel , and Wan Wan Thai Cafe serving bingsu desserts till 3am everyday! It's also near shopping areas like Bugis and Dhoby Ghuat. A secret tip - there's a game at the lift where if you spot the differences, you get a free wine from the bar downstairs ;) I would definitely come back to stay again with Hotel G! ",

It\u2019s still manageable even though the bed is fitted tightly at the corner which means one of the guests would have a hard time going to the toilet in the middle of the night.  Service wise, we had a warm welcome by manager Darryl, a much kinder greeting than our first stay. He allowed us early check in, likely since it was a Friday so there might have more available rooms.

There wasn\u2019t much TV channel available as well.   Do note that there\u2019s only 1 complimentary parking for an exit so I do not advise you to drive there as parking is pretty expensive. $1/30 mins for weekdays and weekends. It would be great if Hotel G is able to look into this.",

But during my last trip, due to Covid concerns I decided to hunker down in privacy for my 16 hour layover. YOTELAIR did not disappoint. It definitely didn't give hotel vibes upon arrival, but no matter. What I paid for was the bed, and what a bed it was! It was adjustable in every possible permutation I could imagine, which was handy since it was just about the only piece of furniture in the room. The room itself could fit into a bathroom in a Marina Bay Sands suite, which makes it all the more remarkable how much they manage to fit\u2026",

To me staycation mean can enjoy myself in hotel even in own country Singapore.  Unfortunately, upon checking in at 12:30 hrs I was rejected. The hotel only allowed to check in at 1800 hrs and MUST check out the following morning by 0900 hrs. Agoda did not clearly stated on the hotel check in/out policy timing on the voucher. The receptionist lady kind enough allowed me to check in 2 hrs earlier at 1600 hrs.  It seems more to me staying for transit instead of staycation \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I received a confirmation email from Yotel and only then did they inform me that CHECK IN TIME IS AFTER 6PM AND CHECKOUT TIME IS BEFORE 9AM!   That is a half day\u2019s stay and yet they charge a full day\u2019s fee! It would have been acceptable if they showed these in bold letters during the reservation process. None of the sort.  Unfortunately this did not coincide with my plans.  I needed to be able to rest from a long flight and be able to checkin by 2pm as most hotels allow.  I emailed to request but the hotel reverted with a closed-for-the-day reply.  I cancelled and informed third party reservation site to request for a waiver of penalties.  Of course Yotel changi refused. So, remember, half day stay only! And\u2026",

The Premium Queen Cabin was larger than expected with enough room to manoeuvre around our two suitcases providing we placed them upright against the wall after we had taken what we needed from them. The bed was very comfy indeed and the idea of the electric tilt and lower was fabulous. Raise up and you have a place to sit comfortably whilst watching the TV and lower, you have a bed! The bathroom was a good size, not much different to some normal hotel rooms and it all worked very well indeed. I had been a little cautious of not having a window, but it didn\u2019t bother me in the slightest once I saw what the room was like. The location inside Jewel was unbeatable, just a one minute\u2026",

Had a chance to walk all 6 storeys of the mega mall.  The food oferings in the basement levels were good.  Each floor had a different targeted audience which makes shopping easy.    Saw a good number of people making use of the early check in counters on the first.  Having a good view of the Vortex attraction from their lounge was also another a plus.  With friendly staff and clean rooms.  Not a bad overnight stay.",

The location just can\u2019t be beat, so convenient and about a 30 second walk from my room to the view of the Rain Vortex.  I stayed one night before my flight out of Singapore. Check in and check out was super easy and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  I have previously stayed in a Yotel and my only real gripes were that I found the bed somewhat uncomfortable and the sound of people coming and going outside my room at night was quite noisy and kept waking me up.  All in all great value for money in a great location.",

Note that check-in is 6PM, however we arrived at 4.30PM and were allowed to go straight in. Not sure if booking direct made a difference to this. Pros: superb bedding for two, nice shower, short walking distance to the terminal. Cons: premium pricing for a small room. Coffee and tea is available in the reception area, wifi is strong, wake-up call at 4AM is done by a real person and you get to enjoy Jewel during your transit without your carry-on. If you need a bigger room, there's a Crowne Plaza in T3, or other hotels around the city. Would I stay here again? Yes, if I've less than 20-hour in Singapore and I get to sleep in for another\u2026",

The mechanism on the bed allows you to choose fully flat or tilted up - it's that easy. The en-suite shower room even has toothbrushes and toothpaste and plenty of good quality towels. We parked our cases in the Baggage Storage facility in Jewel for a few hours and then used the nearby early check-in. Then we were free of baggage to look around and have dinner.  An early morning wake-up call from Reception next day, a good continental breakfast here and off we went - all of a five minute walk to Terminal 1. No more taxi rides across town in the traffic. Will definitely stay here again - also\u2026",

It really reduced the stress to be able to just take a short walk to or from the airport facilities (literally a 5-minute walk when we departed) without the cost or hassle of navigating to/from downtown. It's a super modern facility with a robot who can check you in or deliver towels, etc.(there's humans too!). The famous rain vortex is just steps away from the check-in desk. The rooms are called cabins because they are super small like a cruise ship cabin but well designed to make use of the space and really comfortable beds. It's a good 10-15 minute walk to the subway station but all inside with some moving walkways.",

This is really unacceptable, I called back the hotel and now another lady claims that they found the booking and there's duplicate.  Called Agoda for a refund but claimed that 3rd party does not honor this.  If it is our mistake, we will gladly accept this but this is a mistake of a check in staff.

We booked thru Agoda reservation#445632169.  The manager told us it was a glitch in Agoda's system. However since we are stranded with two young kids at 4am in the lobby we had the privilege of watching the manager sell another story to another family. They too have been told their reservation is unavailable due to a glitch! So it would seem it's not Agoda but Yotel with an internal problem.  The manager was hoping we would walk and try and sort it out with Agoda.  Please note it's not an easy task to get a hold of Agoda when the booking goes wrong.

The biggest issue for us was the inability to sleep due to the noise from the adjoining room and the hallway. We could hear every time someone walked past - which is a lot in an airport-based hotel!   Also, I see another reviewer mentioned that the bedding for adults was more substantial than for the kids. This makes it very difficult to set a temperature for everyone to enjoy. Looks like the child bedding was best, as the room never actually got very cool even when set at 21 degrees.   While the beds were comfy, the room clean and the location good, I can't rate this hotel any higher as we left exhausted from a poor night's sleep.",
