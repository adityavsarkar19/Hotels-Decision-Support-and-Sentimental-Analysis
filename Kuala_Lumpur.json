The suite was extremely huge with a very well equipped kitchen (pots, pans, plates etc). You could totally have a cooking party in this room. The only unfortunate thing about this room was the view. Our windows were blocked by the building facade and hence despite being on a very high floor, our view was severely limited. Gym was tiny but well equipped. Not forgetting the amazing view from the gym. Breakfast selection was slightly limited and guests had to walk around to get the food which was not great in hindsight in view of the current pandemic.  Overall, a fairly decent stay. Will I return? Maybe when the pool reopens.",

Actually the stay is for the celebration of my grandmum's 84th. Its located at the Iconic Menara Ilham and being one of the most tallest hotel in KL (after Four Seasons). The interior design of this hotel is not the typical hotel - look more like corporate setting due to the function of Ilham Tower I guess.  Here's some pointers of our experience during our short staycation.  Pros: (1) Location - it is considered as central within the KLCC district. What you can ask more? (2)  Amenities - The studio room is fully equipped with all necessities. There are plates, cutlery, dishwashing liquid, microwave, minibar, safe deposit, iron with board, decent\u2026",

I would see it has a significant improve since my last visit.  In terms of quality and standards it beats Four Points. It is slightly more expensive but I would pay to stay here - due to the overall experience. The finishing of the building is also much better which means better soundproof.   One setback is their door doesn\u2019t shut completely when you leave so you need to PULL it. Unlike other hotels the weight of the door and the moment you let it go it closes by itself. Got to be careful with that. \u2026",

Breakfast buffet was very tasty and had a great variety and food at the restaurant was pretty reasonable for dinner. Great service by all whom I came in contact with.    My favorite activity to at the hotel was the pool. Sadly the Elements pool is indoors but has STUNNING views while you swim!!There were three is us at the pool just gazing at the view from the end of pool. BREATHTAKING!

The lift is super fast and you hardly notice how far u have to travel.  The room was quite modern and had a small kitchenette.

To be honest, I love going back to this hotel because of its central location in Kuala Lumpur and easy access via the Ampang Park LRT station. The lobby is located at Level 40 at the Ilham Building which also housed one of the best galleries in the city. One thing I really love about this hotel is their food. We were served delicious tea break right after the event. Earlier this year, I had a lunch at the hotel during the Ramadan month and it was a memorable experience sitting by the window looking out at the amazing KL view while having our 4-course meal. I would recommend this place but do make your reservation because the hotel restaurant can get really packed and busy these days. ",

Special shout out to Leanne (reception area), because she is never seen without a smile on her face and she'd always greet us with a warm welcome. So much pleasure when she's the one handling our check-in, thank you, Leanne.   What we don't love: - Not a very kids friendly kind of hotel as there is no wading pool or kids room. There's only 1 cartoon channel on the TV which doesn't work most of the time. I'd like it better if they offer Disney Junior channel as it's more suitable for toddlers and younger\u2026",

During the span of our stay, we were presented with cakes for our birthday and also apples with a welcome letter.  While there are a lot of luxurious and expensive hotel around the city, this hotel manage to distinguish itself through the basic fundamental of hospitality : Service.  You can feel their generosity throughout the stay, you will never feel anything pushy, most importantly, you felt that it's worth every penny spent.

There could be 5 waiters in the room and no one saw us and the place wasn\u2019t even super full. Midway through our brunch Mr Belle started his shift and service became impeccable again.

The room I was in was very cosy and I felt right at home. The twin beds could accommodate my parents and I, it was perfect. The free mini bar and coffee machine in the room was a nice treat too.   In a pandemic period where breakfast buffets are no longer the norm, room service seems to be the way to go... However, the breakfast card was a tad confusing for my parents to figure out.

Telling them the purpose of our stay during booking via email, they prepared cakes & little treats for all our children (3). I ordered deco which costed RM80 and they did it exactly as per the catalogue, nothing more :)  We had the city-view room at 17th floor. Extra bed was given at no extra charges. The amenities are over the top - always love L'occitane products. They have a tablet in room where you can directly chat and/or request for anything with housekeeping or even food or spa. You can even actually just Whatsapp them and they will respond promptly!  I requested for the kids bathrobe & slippers, which was quite and they kids really enjoyed as they get to feel something customized for them instead of always seeing only adults get it :D The changing room by the pool is pretty impressive. Luxuriously designed and with sauna & steam bath. Small, but there were barely people there although it was Sunday morning, so we had the sauna all to ourselves. Separate for male & female though. Small wading pool for children. I think their pool is salted water which is a plus point. Overall its a great stay for couples & business, even with friends or solo. but for family I have my reservations due to the many sharp edges in the room. My daughter got a purple cheek when she slipped and bumped the bathtub handle, which the corner is pretty sharp. Luckily not hit the eye. I also notified the reception during check out there is a tiny sharp metal at their carpet (something like a stapler bullet) that I stepped on. Hope they managed to find & remove it before someone else got hurt. KLCC is just a walk away. Hence why its a perfect city staycation. Would love to return again for a relaxing stay :) Met my expectations for a hotel with such brand.\u2026",

We have faced the problem from times to times the stay but the hotel took immediate action to solved the problem. This is something that four seasons a five stars hotel definitely earn it. We have problem with checking in as staffing was not offering to take our bag and some of the staff seems not to be updated in the information regarding the readiness of the facilities. I would suggest that the hotel staff should communicated in the same language. Moving to the 1st room, we have baht tub and toilet issues which we moved to 2nd room with lighting and speaker issue, 3rd room, we have the television issue and water issue. However, with changing room quite often. Me and my wife didnt want to change further anymore. On the last day, the lift of the hotel have the issue as well but it was okay. Despite the issue in every room that we stayed, we still loved the hotel and service that was offered to us. We went for the spa and the service is very nice. We also dine in Yu house almost every other day of our stay and love the food there. Bar facilities was great and cozy atmosphere. Swimming pool was a surprise to me that they even have music under the water, definitely one of the new experience. The curate restaurant where we have our daily breakfast is definitely recommended. Great variety of food and taste is nice. The sous chef is also very friendly as he talked with us most of the day. Overall, the staff is very friendly and always there to help us. The personalized service that allow us to communicate with them seamlessly is fantastics.

I had also told them that this was my daughter's belated birthday treat, and they really went all out to make my little girl feel so special, which i appreciated.  They decorated our room, they had a birthday cupcake ready for her but more importantly, they really went out way to give us personalized service that made us feel so welcomed and at home. Everyone knew our name and made sure to check that we were okay\u2026",

Let me just start that the parking navigation need some work but thats beyond their control, for now haha.   Everything was magnificent. From the lobby experience, calling us by our names (no i haven't even introduce myself) to the reception (upgraded our rooms and friendly staff) it already sets the scene that it is going to be such a personalized stay.   Rooms were impeccable, the decoration was immaculate. Everything was how its was to be and more. The view overlooking the KLCC park was breathtaking. Not the first time we stay in a hotel\u2026",

During the pandemic, they kindly made our staycation above par. They prepared the room incredibly with not just flowers, but decorations on bed, chocolates and gifts and so many other things. We were amazed. The food at breakfast was also great spread and we were one of the few staying there. We couldn't fault it at all, even check in was in our room! Wow!  We felt like we were treated like royalty, that is the FS motto I suspect.  They knew our names, they still remember us every time we pass by when we park at the Robinsons to go to KLCC and we pass by the foyer. Loveliest service of any KL hotel we've been in.

The room given was superb. In the year of the pandemic, they even upgraded my room to one with an amazing view.   Admittedly, I had to do a bit of hotel-hopping for work in November. However, I fell in love with FSKL from the moment I stepped into the room. The beds are VERY comfortable which I had to refrain myself from as I had to work late that night. The coffee machine was a lifesaver and choice of pods, awesome!   Breakfast spread was good and value for money, that's for sure!

The team really took care of us - they really went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.  Special thanks to Mr Saiful and the Curate Team for coordinating a surprise birthday cake with my wife. We even received a complimentary anniversary muffin during one of our breakfasts. On that note, the delicious breakfast spread was amazing - certainly something we look forward to every morning! They don't do buffet now since it's CMCO so we had to order a la carte. The portion was big and they were definitely delicious!  Special thanks to Ms Tee Vee who personally made sure our room was perfect, knowing full well it was our honeymoon. The room,\u2026",

During booking we mentioned it was our Honeymoon and we were greeted with special towel decorations and desserts in the room. The hand written note was also a nice touch.   The rooms are nice and the bathroom is really nice. With an electric (Japanese style) toilet and bidet, a separate rain shower and plush floor mats. There was also a bathtub, but we didn\u2019t use it. There were decent quality toiletries. But when we arrived there was an extra conditioner but a body\u2026",

I know my wife was all stressed up, so I decided to book a 2 night stay from 5 - 7 Sept 2020. We were thankful that the hotel put us up in room 2902 and the view was splendid! Without having to elaborate, I just simply can say the stay was awesome with everyone that was involved with my stay was top notch. Only tiny disappointment was first day lunch at Lai  Po Heen. When you miss / forgotten to deliver an order/item for the Dim Sum lunch, you disturb the dining flow which otherwise I could have rated it 10/10. Looking forward for a return trip.",

Also, the best part was I got a special deal during the 11.11 sale.  What I like abt my stay: - Very spacious room with a great layout. Separate bidet toilet flows into wardrobe, powder room n lastly rain shower n bathtub area. A very big size bathtub ! - When I checked in, the welcoming officer (Chloe) brought me a tour of the room and explained the features i.e. what switch to turn on/off, how to use the coffee maker, explained different functions of rain shower etc. - Another feature that I like is their turndown service. At 6pm there will be housekeeping staff came to the room, light up the aromatherapy diffuser (they hv different scent each\u2026",

Cool to just relax here by the pool.  Breakfast on the main coffee house is just average. Staff on duty were bit warm and cold: unlike other property in PJ. Limited breakfast option. Food tasted just average. I feel that menu and food taste need further improvement.  Overall, I would say just OK for short stay. Maybe just maybe if this property takes extra measure by further train their staff; I believe improvement can be achieved.

One of the highlight was that we can choose to have dinner in Vasco's.  What a major disappointment.  Yes, we understand that there's no buffet, however, the ala carte menu is simply disappointing. It was not worth the extra we paid. And the taste, it could be better for this h\u00f4tel. I could not even finish my pasta. It was that bad. Ordered a hot chocolat\u00e9, tasted like the instant version. Left a bad taste in my mouth.  I am not so sure what's with this package. Ever since we checked-in, this h\u00f4tel wanted to charge us extra. Lucky for us, we have our booking confirmation in hand, else they wanted to charge us higher. Also, in the restaurant, know your right that you can receive 25% off on food. They wanted to charge the full price. It was a mess. Don't get me started on the service.   Thank goodness for the pool. We had a wonderful time relaxing by the pool. It's really huge and that's only because they share it with the h\u00f4tel next door. I would say this pool is the highlight of our trip.  Can't comment much on the room. I had a suspicion that we are short changed because we took the package. The room that we usually stayed in feels larger.   All in all, be careful when you choose the 'Gourmet Staycation'. Don't put your expectations too high or you'll be disappointed. And know your entitlements. \u2026",

Comfy bed and stunning lakeview from the room! The bathroom was spacious with bathtub and separate shower.  Buffet breakfast was good even though it has less choice due to the SOP of RMCO.   What impressed me was their excellent customer service. They attended to all my request, very prompt and items were delivered to the room as soon as they arrange it for you. Kudos to the superb customer service!   Furthermore, the hotel is very well maintained and clean! Having said that, you can see every effort was made to ensure that cleanliness and hygiene was maintained.   Will definitely return again!",

It's almost half of my room rate! Imagine that if I go out the next day or few days later? Does the hotel realize how nonsense it is?  At the first place there is no warning sign of using the Touch N Go at the parking entrance especially for the hotel guest that at least will stay for a night. Furthermore, there was no information or explanation at all regarding the parking fee during checking-in. After complaining to concierge, they said they won\u2019t compensate the amount charged on my Touch N Go card. Do\u2026",

I've been trying different types of hotel and different types of room. It was a good experience on how every hotel deal with the current pandemic.  What I like :- The staggered breakfast session. During check in, you have to choose your slot. 3 slots available with one break for sanitize session. This made me feel confident that they really taking things seriously.  What can be improved :- They should apply the same format for the swimming pool. Pre determined the slot, limit no of people in the pool and allocate time for sanitisation. Please ensure only properly attired guests are allowed in the pool. To have those with Jersey, shirts were big NO. You don't even\u2026",

Kristen gave us a warm welcome and a run down of the operating hours of the gym and pool. In terms of the rooms, there were stickers at the edge of the doors to indicate that the rooms have been sanitized, with towels and bathrobes placed in sealed boxes. As for the restaurant (Vasco), it was table service for the buffet which was an interesting concept, however, perhaps due to the lack of resources, we were not attended to when we require service. Thankfully the Exec Chef and the Exec Sous Chef saved the day (on two separate occasions) as they were very attentive. Kudos to the both of them.

Some things could have been better at check in, more informative about how things work in the apartment or at least the correct way to log onto the wifi. I put it down to new staff.  But we figured it out with the general instructions on the website anyway.   The apartment is clean and well designed and functional, everything worked well- top notch kitchen appliances- and the views were amazing on the 18th floor. I loved the toiletries too. The bed was super comfy and we fell asleep to an incredible subwoofed playlist with the KL Tower lights winking at us.   Facilities were great, no complaints.   Breakfast was good - it was served in-room due to the MCO and could have been served with less plastic but on the whole we enjoyed the meal.   The location offers lots of convenience with eateries and we walked to interesting neighbourhoods with some rare heritage architecture; had a lovely 10km morning walk in the vicinity with a satisfying swim afterwards.   The customer service is top notch. The hotel representatives did go out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Big shout-out to Mike for your generous gestures during our stay. We are eternally grateful.   And guess what- we\u2019re visiting again this weekend!   Highly recommended. \u2026",

They were accommodating, they made sure I had everything I needed at all times and there was always someone to help me out.  The pool was closed at first due to the pandemic, but they opened halfway through my stay and I was able to enjoy it, as well as the great cafe they have by the pool, which offers great options for food and drinks.  They were also kind enough to allow my cat to stay with me, and even arranged to help with my move to my new apartment. I have only good things to say about the entire month I soent there, and highly recommend it. The location is also amazing, with lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance.\u2026",

The bedroom is facing the KL Tower, so relaxed seeing the colourful towers blinking at night while laying on the huge comfort bed.     Due to MCO, the breakfast is limited as they served us eggs, salad, hotdog and ham on a plate; fruits in a take away cup. However, you may request for other  stuffs eg cheese, danish and others. Cereals, juices and coffee are free flow. The view from the lounge was spectacular!     You wont get hungry here, you can even cook in the room as the kitchen has all equipment from pan, plates, fork, spoon\u2026even equipped with dish washer.  We walked to the bar street down the street\u2026chankat bukit bintaang. Lots of choices here and further down will be jalan alor which we had local foods there for two consecutive nights.     Its walking distance to Pavillion mall too. The mall was crowded despite during MCO time.

The apartments are large, spacious and well finished with nice furniture and appliances. The view is amazing! Large windows give you a very wide view of the city, yet the windows do open just enough to get in some air from outside if you wish. You would hardly get any apartment as large as the apartments in this property. It is located in a very very quiet and nice place, quiet, yet very close to the bubbly Changkat, Bukit Bintang and the city centre - KLCC areas. Shall I talk of  the staff there?\u2026",

You feel home and you feel small because of its huge space and amenities such as the Pool and Gym. Far from town but I love it because it is away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Food? No problem. Food deliveries are just few buttons away and there nearby restaurants that you could visit too. ",

Spacious living area with large TV and a spacious bedroom with mountains of storage space.  I've lived in much smaller flats.  The building is slightly showing its age but nothing too much worry about.  The 50 meter pool on the 5th floor was also huge. Very pleasant and stylish lounge area on the top floor complete with iMac computers and a pool table.  All the staff were super polite.  Downsides were the under equipped gym (no rowing machine, only a few light weights), the lifts often take an age to arrive and the a/c was slightly noisy but over all fantastic value especially if you like more space.",

Instead, they made us feel more than welcome and provided excellent customer service - above and beyond what was expected. 5 stars and definitely recommend staying at Grand Hyatt.",

Anu did the impossible and made a miracle happen in which he got us a last minute slot at Restaurant 38 for Valentines Day Dinner. I called every single Hotel in Kuala Lumpur and all they could say was fully booked with no intention of helping out at all. Anu is a man who truly cares for his guests. I salute you, Anu.

Every time I asked can u please upgrade my room, or the very least give me a high room with a nice view everything had to charged. Most hotels I have stayed in over the course of my life whenever it was for a special occasion I was always offered an upgrade. Also for the extravagant price I was charged u will think the internet will be excellent unfortunately it was total crap.

The breakfast was great but due to the Covid Pandemic, it has to be staggered to avoid overcrowding. The breakfast is great and with ample selection. Since only 2 time slots allocated, the wait time for breakfast can be a bit long. Maybe if there are 4 time slots of 1 hour each may help to cut down peak waiting time. The room was clean, comfortable and safe. The staff were great, very helpful, responsive and courteous. There were minor housekeeping issues but was speedily resolved by Duty Manager (Encik Hasli) and Housekeeping Manager (Puan Adi). The pool is nice too. Location is great, near to many tourist attractions and public transportation hub. For those who enjoy morning or evening walks/jogs, there is a nice Lake Gardens nearby. Parking is a flat rate of RM15 per day but need to be careful since sometimes it charges 2 per day which happened to us twice.

The e mail informing me of the relocation was rather last minute 1.5 days prior to departure. Needless to say this little incident was rather unsatisfactory as we made plans around Hotel Stripes (restaurant bookings within the vicinity that is walking distance) and being left in the limbo at the eleventh hour.   However Natasha Kok from Majestic's reservation did an excellent job in pacifying me and sorted out the room confirmation and ensuring that i was provided with the room and dining privileges on par with what i booked with Hotel Stripes. In fact, i would like to commend that she went above and beyond and exceeded expectations entirely in ensuring customer satisfaction. This happened to be my third stay with Majestic Hotel and it is their impeccable and exemplary services such as this that they will always have in my books as one of my recommended choice of Hotel for KL. Rest assured that you have my loyalty and return patronage.  Hotel rooms are clean and tastefully furnished although some deep cleaning and minor touch up should serve the hotel well since it has been operational for many years. Buffet breakfast has a smaller spread compared to pre covid times but it is adequate.  Doorman to front desk service were top notched as always. My compliments to the Majestic Hotel team.\u2026",

Initially,i would want to rate this below average,but right before we left the hotel,i would say the rating went from below average to BAD.   1. On the first day, upon arrival my fianc\u00e9 carried all of our luggages on his own. No hotel staff or bell boy offered to help him with it.I felt bad and ran over to give him a hand. 2. Upon arrival, i was told that there will be no breakfast spread as the hotel restaurants are closed. Imagine paying extra for breakfast only to be given this news. ( It should have been stated on their websites),or practise social distancing during breakfast at the restaurant. The restaurants were open for dining during dinner though. -so dinner is allowed but not\u2026",

On both occasions we stayed in the old part of the hotel i.e. not the tower. Our rooms were very clean (thank you Awal for your help and excellent service) and well supplied and the upgrade gave us a free minibar with soft drinks and access to a lounge with happy hour plus. The hotel is within walking distance of the National Museum which is well worth a visit and it is a reasonable walk to Independence Square.

The National Museum is located close by and the other sites are within a walkable distance (20 mins walk).  Only issue I could say is that, other guests rooms can see into yours.

I have however been unable to eat there as there are so many restrictions . Whole month of Ramadan is gone , the month of January for CNY , All public holiday , all peak season ... it just feels like a scam as your never going to be able to use your voucher . Apart from that  I find the fact that there is a cashless parking the most annoying thing . Half the time their gate does not work and you end up being stuck until an angry security guard comes and tells you you have to use a card . What if someone didn\u2019t bring a card . For a 5 star hotel I find them to be very be unaccommodating .i think there are many nicer hotels in the area where can have a much better\u2026",

I know the location is good but that doesn\u2019t prop the property rating up. Pool was not as glamorous as in the photos, neither was the gym. The best part of our experience there were the congenial doormen. Always with a smile and helpful. I wouldn\u2019t go there again nor recommend it to anyone.",

The kitchen was well appointed and I really appreciated the washer/dryer. Such a treat when travelling, particularly in a hot climate. Staff are very pleasant and helpful and will go out of their way to assist. It is within walking distance of the Twin Towers but if not inclined to walk taxis are readily available but remember to bargain if doing your own booking. The gym and pool are wonderful assets. The cafe\u2019s breakfast buffet leaves a lot be desired.Very limited choices - hot food not hot, cereals taste stale coffee/ tea not good. So don\u2019t pay to have breakfast included - unfortunately a waste of money.",

Great location, door/security Guys were always polite and it has a washing machine.   Pros, great location, door staff very polite.  Now for the cons.  Room was old and tired and no way reflected the pictures on the website. Room (1413) was dirty in a lot of places and had not been dusted in a while. Look at the pictures to see for your own eyes.   Tired decor and mould in the mastic around the shower, very dusty under the bed, on the door and the lampshade. Air con unit in room had been leaking down the wall and the plaster had bubbled up and was brown so needs repair.  The picture of the lampshade shows dust all\u2026",

No concierge insight to help us with our lugguages upon arrival.  Upon entering the suite, probably its a corner unit, it was pitched dark upon entering. Only after we slot in the card then there was light. There were no face towel in the bathroom, 2 bath towels and a handtowel.  Front desk couldnt really help with places to recommend to us to go for makan. They only have one standard pillow which is high n uncomfortable.  Best part of the hotel was the doormen, they put a smile to us everytime we enter and leave the hotel.  Shuttle service was good as they alight us at various stops outside of hotel suites.

I booked and paid for a two-bedroom but due to your own problem, you didn't offer any solution but down grade your guest! What kind of service is it?  After my serious complain to front desk, she finally agreed to offer a connected room for us. We then went to the so called connected room with your bell boy but found out that it was a joke!

It's in the heart of the touristy Bukit Bintang with a lot of things at walking distance.

After clarifying what we wanted, they took another long period of time to come with the pillows and blanket. Day 1: We were told only 2 breakfasts were provided for our room. Had to pay our child's. Paid RM20+ for her to have an egg and a glass of water. Breakfast choices very limited and guests were fighting for the food like it was going to run out any second.

Raju from Housekeeping never fails to bring a smile to our face each time we bump into him at the hallway, he even went out of his way to place flowers on our bed knowing that it will be our last night there.

Check-in was a bit hectic because of an event in PWTC; a lot of people checking in and out. Lines were long. But I went for lunch as soon as I got there. 2 hours later, my room was still not yet ready. I booked for a Deluxe Suit, because of the long wait, they upgraded my room to Family Room instead! Yeay! Thanks SPH!   The buffet was great! The Mee Kari was unforgettable! I wish I had more room to stomach that Mee Kari! Haha! Will definitely be back for that Mee Kari. The Western Breakfast was my daughter's favorite. The staffs were very accommodating for a family with little ones like me.   I like that they followed the SOP in using the pool where we have to book 2 hours earlier to use it. But, when we were swimming, suddenly a huge crowd came rushing in. I doubt they ever booked their time to use the pool because it was surely more than 10 people at one time already. SPH should monitor closely on this. I force my family to go back to our room as soon as the pool got a bit crowded.  I did request for an extra laundry bag but it didn't come. I had to purchase plastic bags outside myself.  The lifts are superb! Though it was an old installation but it is very fast and well maintained. Good job SPH!  Other than that, it was a pleasant stay. Love it and will repeat again.

Enjoy complimentary buggy service to Suria KLCC via KLCC park entrance, you save your sweat and time by reaching fast at the famous mall in the country.

When I checked with the hotel a few days ago to confirm my reservation, they claimed not to have received payment and requested for payment again. After checking with Agoda and my credit card issuer on my payment which had been successfully collected by the hotel, they still claimed that they have not received payment.  Only when I wanted to file a police report for a fraudulent transaction by the hotel and data privacy breach that the hotel reverted to confirm they have received payment.

A couple of things prevent me from giving the hotel 5/5 . The 'hot' options at breakfast were lukewarm at best and the food selection is geared more to Asian guests rather than Europeans. The air-con in our room was inefficient . However I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again and would highly recommend it .

I do not regret in any way, saying yes and accepting the upgrade. Our room was 2713 on the 27th floor, with a wonderful view of the towers and the park. There is a good sized pool on the 33 floor, next to the Sky bar. Buffet breakfast was excellent, everything that I could possibly want.

Being a third party agency here in China, my fianc\u00e9 can have a local Malaysian heritage and cultural experiences so that he can share his experience with the relevant parties here.   In the early morning of 26 January 2020 estimated 08:10hrs, I was about to leave the Hotel for reunion at parents, unfortunately, there was a high threshold between the bed chamber and bathroom, I crossed, slipped and fell down in the bathroom of room 455 due to slippery floor, caused my head to hit the ground injured the back of my head, with a lot of blood rushed out from the injured area. I remained calm and made a call to the operator to inform about my injury while blood was spurting from the wound. My fianc\u00e9 and I waited for someone from the Hotel to bring us to the hospital for medical treatment, however we were not able to wait any longer as I was seriously injured and my wound was bleeding, time is of the essence, I was conscious and able to walk down to the lobby to seek for assistance. There was someone from the Hotel came and checked on my condition and arranged a car to send us off to Prince Court Medical Centre without someone from the Hotel to accompanying us to further understand the condition. If this incident has happened to someone at my home, I could have been taken further steps to keep her / him accompanied. Being someone in the hospitality and tourism industry for almost 15 years, I truly believe this is very basic and necessary.  If there is a threshold installed, the edges should be sloped or have an non-slip surface and be adequately secured to the floor. This is important, as the person would encounter an unexpected, increasing the chances for a fall. Ideally, the floor surfaces should be consistent. If hotel guests understand the dangers of a wet bathroom floor, then hotel management must also know and thus take precautions to protect your guests by placing a rubber mat on the floor of the shower or bathroom to prevent skidding.   Slipping in the shower or tub is no laughing matter, bathroom falls typically mean violent contact with hard surfaces, which may result in head trauma, broken bones or even death. I suffered a serious head injury when I fell, I may still be dealing with the after effects such as headache which I do encounter such symptom sometimes.   During our stay at your Hotel after this incident occurred, none of the employees from your Hotel taken effort to check on my condition, not even a simple call or to leave a message in the room. When we approached the front desk to call for the duty manager for a meet up, we had been asked by the staffs repeatly what purpose was that for while there was bandage around my head, which I felt it was a total negligence from the Hotel.  The response from the Hotel was slow during the follow up process which was due to limitation of movement and documents searches, which I completely understand, nonetheless, it took almost half a year. I thought there would be a fair conclusion after a real long investigation by the agency, unfortunately, the conclusion is \u201cthere is no insurance coverage\u201d.   None of the insurance agencies had contacted me throughout the 'investigation process\" and the case closed just by sending me a message via WhatsApp without an official response via email.   We loved the location and ambience of the Hotel and we did considered your Hotel as one of the venues for our wedding ceremony next year, nevertheless, we will not proceed further due to bad experiences.\u2026",

Thumbs up to this 1st impression gave by Ms. HAYATI.   Room was enormous & spotless clean. The downside are housekeeping didnt clear up the minibar, dialled no.1 from room phone to get housekeeping to clear it for me & a male operator working night shift on 4th Sept asked me to clear it by myself (whattt????????)  The water conditions during my stay was not really ok. It\u2019s not hotel\u2019s fault. Whole Kuala Lumpur facing water supply problem due to shutdown of main supply tank. A maintenance guy came to checked & told me duty manager (5th Sept 2020 1230am) will come within 10 minutes time to check on my room condition but nobody show up.   Pros:  1. Superb front office team (5/5) 2. Breakfast buffet menu (5/5) 3. Maintenance team (5/5) 4. Hotel cleanliness (5/5) 5. Knowledgeable concierge team (5/5) 6. Pool for kids & adults (5/5)  Cons: 1. Not alert duty manager (5th Sept, 1230am shift) 2. Poor Operator (4th Sept, 1145pm)  Hope you guys have a great time staying in this hotel :)  \u2026",

Would highly recommend this hotel...I will stay again, for sure. Thanks again guys & girls at the RC. See you all again soon! Kym",

The downside is the lack of foreign channels and the non existent children ones.  You can also hear the thunder or someone driving fast and screeching their brakes. It is very well insulated. The AC is fine. The breakfast has a good range and the quality is adequate, nothing special or delicious, just fine. As for the staff they are reasonably friendly but not extra friendly.

We were told breakfast was served until 11am but when we came down at 9.50am, most of the food was gone and they did not replenish. Even the drinks counter were empty - only the coffee machine works.   3. The lobby has a strong smell of lemon-grass. It is nice but just too much.   4.

Room size is considered big with a huge bath tub that can open up to the room itself. The TV provided is 32\u201d. In my opinion, it is abit small for the room size. The carpet in the room feels like it has not beem chemically washed or shampooed for awhile. I usually walk about in a hotel room barefooted, but for this room, i had to use the bedroom slippers provided. Besides that, the room generally is not too bad.

Another point that I would like to highlight is that the hotel has regulations on wearing a singlet to the Warisan Caf\u00e9. Well, I experienced it first hand.

Good option if you are staying in KL and don't want a traditional hotel - it is sort of like an apartment. There is a microwave in the room and fridge, but if you want to do your own cooking then you have to reserve a space in the kitchen. It is also very good for offering laundry service - there are washing machines and dryers present.

The views are quite nice from my room, be it facing TM tower or facing Novum condo, there is a large window where you can enjoy the city views day and night. The studio suite has a comfortable super single bed, a pantry and fridge where you can prepare simple meals, Smart TV and hot shower. There is a rooftop swimming pool, lookout deck and gym at level 29, however due to CMCO was not able to enjoy the swimming facilities. The front desk service will be a hit and miss, most of the times they are very nice, occasionally you will meet one that is unfriendly. I am very pleased with the services\u2026",

TV cable with the channel consist of minimum Fox movie, Nat Geo, Discovery Channel, HBO 2. Tooth paste and brush. If it is not provided, better specified some information about it hence, customer could self prepare in advance.  3. Hotel's restaurant menu for dinner and lunch.  4. if somehow the management decide to escalate the rate, hope to see various free facilities and more varied breakfast being served in the hotel's restaurant.",

Amenities are down to the bare minimum, soap, tissue, toilet rolls and bath towels. Actually, that's all i need!  Staff are very helpful. I requested for an iron and ironing board and he immediately put down his work and delivered the items to me. 5 star service!  Breakfast is fantastic! There's fried mee hoon, sausages, vegetables. bread, butter & jam, salad, yogurt, cereals, orange juice and some pastries. I did not venture outside to the frying stations.   Check-in and check-out are done thru the machine, which is very user friendly and only takes about 3 minutes.  I paid RM110 for a night's stay. Tremendous value for money!

Need to pick up the iron, iron board and hairdryer by ourselves at the reception. Microwave is available but no spoon/fork/plates provided.

On the 23rd of April , Tuesday, the day I landed in Kuala Lampur from Colombo , I checked into the hotel metro which is located in Bukit Bintang . At 10 pm after I had dinner from Starbucks, I came to the hotel lounge to have a seat while I was on a call with my girl friend. Mr Sunder and employee of the hotel as a receptionist was smiling and I wanted to give him chewing gum after handing him it  he complimented saying I was handsome .After coming back to my seat few moment later he comes to where I was seated .He then touched and squeezed my leg.After I was done talking to my girlfriend  I wanted to go into my room. As we were only provided with one key card for both me and my father I wanted to ask for another so I won\u2019t be disturbing my father who was sleeping inside. When I went to ask for another sunder asked me inside his room , said he practiced ayurveda and started touching me . Even after exclaiming I wanted to leave he continued to ask questions about my food preferences and touched me inappropriately.\u2026",

My partner and I were given a room at the highest floor, the room was spacious and very well kept. The service was great as the housekeeper attend to our requests with smiles. We were lucky enough to catch the very limited free parking spaces provided by the hotel too, which is a major plus seeing that the parking fees around that area were pretty expensive. All in all, good experience, great stay for their location and for the price they offer.",

As for breakfast buffet, we had the chance to discover the local cuisine which we thoroughly enjoyed along with continental items.  The staff is very courteous, helpful and friendly. They were always ready to give us advice and they even prepared us a bountiful packed breakfast on the day of our departure.

One of the front desk person was also BAD at\u2026",

Reservation department was very good, checked with me a couple of times regarding my bookings. My last email to the reservation department was to request for early check-in at noon as well as special requests for higher floor and a room facing away from construction sites or a close-up building.  Morning of my check-in I called up to Front Desk to check what time I could check-in. Was told my room would be ready for my early arrival.   CHECK-IN Room was ready and check-in process completed quickly. Room assigned was however not satisfactory due to its view being blocked by a nearby building. Thus, I called down to ask for a room change to another view. Reception (Margaret if I\u2019m not mistaken) offered to show me another room and we were brought to room 2430. It had a better view (not so blocked off) and it was also bigger. We gladly moved.  I was pleasantly surprised due to some reviews mentioning the apartments being dated in comparison to the hotel rooms. Actually the photos do not do justice to the actual room. The photos make the room darker. It was in actual fact, more cheerful.  My room despite being quite plain, was cosy and nice. Bed was comfortable and big. Kitchen well equipped and bathroom complete with all toiletries. A lot of storage. Excellent hot water and strong water pressure. The only thing was I couldn\u2019t alter the temperature of the air conditioners. MEALS Club floor benefits like Afternoon Tea and Cocktail Hour were served at the Junction, which was right by the lobby. It was ok but still a pity since I would have loved the Club Lounge. Afternoon tea consisted of 2 types of sandwiches, a savoury bakery, 3 types of pudding and fruits. Hot drinks as well as freshly squeezed juices like orange and green apple. As for Cocktail Hour, you get drinks like wine, beer, above mentioned juices, soft drinks and hot drinks, 3 types of canap\u00e9s, cheese platter and fruits. On both days Sue took very good care of us. She was friendly and always made us feel very welcome, and regularly checking if we wanted anything replenished.  Breakfast was quite limited, just American and 3 Asian breakfasts. However, we could order more than 1.   FACILITIES  Due to MCO many facilities were not available. Gym just reopened. Went to check it out but didn\u2019t utilise. Nicely air conditioned. There were towels and bottle waters.   LOCATION Excellent, so close to Pavilion Mall.   CHECK-OUT Was pleasantly surprised to find out that the front desk staff had accorded me a late check-out till 5pm without me asking for it. Love it!  In conclusion, would I return? Yes, definitely! Especially once the Club Lounge reopens.\u2026",

They mitigate the risk by having only their staff to man the buffet stations and serve out the food. It is no more self service. During this time the hotel section is closed off and only the apartments are available (better value for money but more run down I suspect). The jacuzzi pool needs better maintenance: water was dark green and the water jets are powered off before 1pm, presumably to save money. Dark green water = not chlorinated, not clean. Eek. Service in the restaurant was top notch. Kudos to Tommy, Sue and team in Sedap Restaurant. Food was excellent. Seriously. Like caviar!

Location is very central, in a busy area (Bukit Bintang) just opposite a famous mall Pavilion. In my opinion the best of the hotel was the breakfast. So many choices but the top was the roti canai station, absolutely fantastic. So were the freshly squeezed juices.

One of my favourite parts was the breakfast in Sedap restaurant - I've never seen so much choice before and I've travelled to many destinations! The waitress was also friendly when I attempted to say Selamat Pagi to her so we left feeling quite happy.  The only negative was that we did not get our sheets changed overnight - unfortunately we must have signalled for Do not Disturb after mistaking the buttons on the wall for light switches (see picture).\u2026",

Went to lounge, the staff were busy chit chatting loudly instead of concentrating on the guests needs. Rooms were dusty. Hair dryer not provided.

The plus points are definitely its location though, very close to TAPAK urban dining, avenue k and the renowned KLCC tower. And also the aeroline departure point to singapore or penang is extremely handy.  I would say this is a good transit hotel. Facilities are very old school, reminds me of the puteri pacific hotel in Johor Bahru. But I would think this is still family friendly as it has a pool for the kids and hearty breakfast as well as large lounge reception area- all very conventional ticks for hotels.  I also wish the frontline had masks on or made it compulsory for people unwell to put on masks and get sanitized. Saw few dubious tourists coughing away loudly at the reception area.\u2026",

Got outselves a good upgrade to the Club Floor. Evening cocktail at the club lounge was bliss. We enjoyed every bit of it, not to mention exceptional service from a lovely Miss Ayu. She was very helpful and had gone the extra mile in making us feel so much at home. Will definitely return on our next visit. Keep up the good hospitality!!",

The shower was awesome! Huge rainfall shower head and great pressure. Had a nice dinner there, a la carte, not the buffet. No laundry facilities. Pool was ok. Excellent location. Close to LRT, MRT and Monorail. Opposite an awesome huge new mall with many food options.
