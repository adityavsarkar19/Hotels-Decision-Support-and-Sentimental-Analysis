The suite was extremely huge with a very well equipped kitchen (pots, pans, plates etc). You could totally have a cooking party in this room. The only unfortunate thing about this room was the view. Our windows were blocked by the building facade and hence despite being on a very high floor, our view was severely limited. Gym was tiny but well equipped. Not forgetting the amazing view from the gym. Breakfast selection was slightly limited and guests had to walk around to get the food which was not great in hindsight in view of the current pandemic.  Overall, a fairly decent stay. Will I return? Maybe when the pool reopens.",

Actually the stay is for the celebration of my grandmum's 84th. Its located at the Iconic Menara Ilham and being one of the most tallest hotel in KL (after Four Seasons). The interior design of this hotel is not the typical hotel - look more like corporate setting due to the function of Ilham Tower I guess.  Here's some pointers of our experience during our short staycation.  Pros: (1) Location - it is considered as central within the KLCC district. What you can ask more? (2)  Amenities - The studio room is fully equipped with all necessities. There are plates, cutlery, dishwashing liquid, microwave, minibar, safe deposit, iron with board, decent\u2026",

I would see it has a significant improve since my last visit.  In terms of quality and standards it beats Four Points. It is slightly more expensive but I would pay to stay here - due to the overall experience. The finishing of the building is also much better which means better soundproof.   One setback is their door doesn\u2019t shut completely when you leave so you need to PULL it. Unlike other hotels the weight of the door and the moment you let it go it closes by itself. Got to be careful with that. \u2026",

Breakfast buffet was very tasty and had a great variety and food at the restaurant was pretty reasonable for dinner. Great service by all whom I came in contact with.    My favorite activity to at the hotel was the pool. Sadly the Elements pool is indoors but has STUNNING views while you swim!!There were three is us at the pool just gazing at the view from the end of pool. BREATHTAKING!

It was strange to begin with as during the week the first thirty nine floors are offices and the hotel reception is on the 40th floor. There is a hotel bar by the reception and there is also an entertainment bar, generally for the office staff but they allow hotel guests to use. The bar has outside balconies with fantastic views. I think the bar was on the 35th floor.",

The breakfast in the morning was decent, the coffee is nice and the buffet spread is sufficient. The service is good and the smiles from the service people make my day.

The lift is super fast and you hardly notice how far u have to travel.  The room was quite modern and had a small kitchenette.

To be honest, I love going back to this hotel because of its central location in Kuala Lumpur and easy access via the Ampang Park LRT station. The lobby is located at Level 40 at the Ilham Building which also housed one of the best galleries in the city. One thing I really love about this hotel is their food. We were served delicious tea break right after the event. Earlier this year, I had a lunch at the hotel during the Ramadan month and it was a memorable experience sitting by the window looking out at the amazing KL view while having our 4-course meal. I would recommend this place but do make your reservation because the hotel restaurant can get really packed and busy these days. ",

So much pleasure when she's the one handling our check-in, thank you, Leanne.   What we don't love: - Not a very kids friendly kind of hotel as there is no wading pool or kids room. There's only 1 cartoon channel on the TV which doesn't work most of the time. I'd like it better if they offer Disney Junior channel as it's more suitable for toddlers and younger\u2026",

During the span of our stay, we were presented with cakes for our birthday and also apples with a welcome letter.  While there are a lot of luxurious and expensive hotel around the city, this hotel manage to distinguish itself through the basic fundamental of hospitality : Service.  You can feel their generosity throughout the stay, you will never feel anything pushy, most importantly, you felt that it's worth every penny spent.

All following SOP and not overcrowding during our visit. However we would like to sincerely ask the chef to relook on their choice of pastries / desserts menu served as some of the food has really odd/weird/unusual pairing of ingredients (November's afternoon tea - the blue theme was wayyyy better than this round's menu). Although we truly understand the specialty of menu but making delicate and delicious food compliment your environment even more. \u2026",

There could be 5 waiters in the room and no one saw us and the place wasn\u2019t even super full. Midway through our brunch Mr Belle started his shift and service became impeccable again.

The room I was in was very cosy and I felt right at home. The twin beds could accommodate my parents and I, it was perfect. The free mini bar and coffee machine in the room was a nice treat too.   In a pandemic period where breakfast buffets are no longer the norm, room service seems to be the way to go... However, the breakfast card was a tad confusing for my parents to figure out.

Telling them the purpose of our stay during booking via email, they prepared cakes & little treats for all our children (3). I ordered deco which costed RM80 and they did it exactly as per the catalogue, nothing more :)  We had the city-view room at 17th floor. Extra bed was given at no extra charges. The amenities are over the top - always love L'occitane products. They have a tablet in room where you can directly chat and/or request for anything with housekeeping or even food or spa. You can even actually just Whatsapp them and they will respond promptly!  I requested for the kids bathrobe & slippers, which was quite and they kids really enjoyed as they get to feel something customized for them instead of always seeing only adults get it :D The changing room by the pool is pretty impressive. Luxuriously designed and with sauna & steam bath. Small, but there were barely people there although it was Sunday morning, so we had the sauna all to ourselves. Separate for male & female though. Small wading pool for children. I think their pool is salted water which is a plus point. Overall its a great stay for couples & business, even with friends or solo. but for family I have my reservations due to the many sharp edges in the room. My daughter got a purple cheek when she slipped and bumped the bathtub handle, which the corner is pretty sharp. Luckily not hit the eye. I also notified the reception during check out there is a tiny sharp metal at their carpet (something like a stapler bullet) that I stepped on. Hope they managed to find & remove it before someone else got hurt. KLCC is just a walk away. Hence why its a perfect city staycation. Would love to return again for a relaxing stay :) Met my expectations for a hotel with such brand.\u2026",

We have faced the problem from times to times the stay but the hotel took immediate action to solved the problem. This is something that four seasons a five stars hotel definitely earn it. We have problem with checking in as staffing was not offering to take our bag and some of the staff seems not to be updated in the information regarding the readiness of the facilities. I would suggest that the hotel staff should communicated in the same language. Moving to the 1st room, we have baht tub and toilet issues which we moved to 2nd room with lighting and speaker issue, 3rd room, we have the television issue and water issue. However, with changing room quite often. Me and my wife didnt want to change further anymore. On the last day, the lift of the hotel have the issue as well but it was okay. Despite the issue in every room that we stayed, we still loved the hotel and service that was offered to us. We went for the spa and the service is very nice. We also dine in Yu house almost every other day of our stay and love the food there. Bar facilities was great and cozy atmosphere. Swimming pool was a surprise to me that they even have music under the water, definitely one of the new experience. The curate restaurant where we have our daily breakfast is definitely recommended. Great variety of food and taste is nice. The sous chef is also very friendly as he talked with us most of the day. Overall, the staff is very friendly and always there to help us. The personalized service that allow us to communicate with them seamlessly is fantastics.

The facilities like gym and pool are well maintained. Excellent hotel service especially at front desk. Miss Teeve, the duty manager was very friendly and professional. But the hotel may need to improve reservations line because I had issue with my reservations. But luckily I was assisted by Miss Pq and Mr Zafran. Good customer service. I also wanted to compliment an excellent service from pool bar & grill, Mr Azhar. For breakfast buffet at Curate, there are many option and choices and the food are delicious. Overall, this is my favourite staycation out of all hotel I went to. Worth every penny that I spend!",

They decorated our room, they had a birthday cupcake ready for her but more importantly, they really went out way to give us personalized service that made us feel so welcomed and at home.

We were amazed. The food at breakfast was also great spread and we were one of the few staying there. We couldn't fault it at all, even check in was in our room! Wow!  We felt like we were treated like royalty, that is the FS motto I suspect.

Whenever I missed their smile, I will always come back here with my family.  Thank you to all in CURATE restaurant for making our meal time\u2026",

The staff here think of every little thing and go above and beyond to make your stay custom tailored just for you. My mother and I stayed here for two nights and booked a stay with the Executive Club package. This is an amazing deal and I would recommend for anyone wanting that extra special service. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi to the last night, everyone was incredibly helpful, knew our names right from when we stepped in, and took care of every last detail. The staff even upgraded our room to a suite which we were blown away by! The afternoon tea was delightful, cocktail hour was amazing and dinner at both Curate and Yun House was outstanding.\u2026",

Ala carte food were available but only limited to one item in the menu per person with no repeats allowed. :( Fortunately, drinks were free flow.  Breakfast spread was severely limited as well.   Overall a good night's stay and due to low occupancy, they allowed me to check out late. Staff were all polite but I have the feeling they are\u2026",

The biggest factor is the staff. And food of course.   I stayed in many luxury hotel in and out of Malaysia. By far, MO Team are the best !  Wait, did I tell you that you can walk to KLCC less than 30 second from MO. Yes! I really enjoy my stay and you should experience it too.  Thanks MO KL Team. I really appreciate your hard work.",

The hotel was very busy as expected but the staff are all attentive, friendly and always trying their best to accommodate us. Expect lines during check-in and check-out Hours during peak weekends like this so I highly suggest going for express check-out option.   We had the BBQ dinner at the poolside one night and the whole family enjoyed it so much. Kids swam and ate while we chilled over some wines and cocktails! Having the beautiful KLCC park and skyline as the pool background is just priceless!  Mandarin Oriental KL still proves to be the legend that it is in the city!

Without having to elaborate, I just simply can say the stay was awesome with everyone that was involved with my stay was top notch. Only tiny disappointment was first day lunch at Lai  Po Heen.

Friendly staff greet you from the parking lot (no kidding!) and all the way to the restaurant, in this case it was Horizon Grill.  The friendly staff continued in Horizon, where if you order steak, then an array of knives are presented for you to choose your weapon against the meat! Unique!  Food was very good, but the view was excellent. It was a clear night and the top floors of the KL Twin Towers were in \"touching distance\". You could see the edges of the city where the light changes to darkness.  Munir, Erwan and Ash were outstanding in their respective roles. Well done, boys!

They were really helpfull and the service was excellence. Their service warm our heart. All other 5 stars hotel should learn from them how to manage guest\u2019s expectation and to ensure the guest is well taken care of. All of the staff that we pass by approached us and ask if all was fine. I cant remember all the staff name but what can I say is from the doorman until their F&B Manager - Iskandar.

Love the closet design which can be access from both sides. Very practical.  Free form pool on level 8 was great. Trees makes it more tropical nature feeling. There is a slide and small waterfall. Cool to just relax here by the pool.  Breakfast on the main coffee house is just average. Staff on duty were bit warm and cold: unlike other property in PJ. Limited breakfast option. Food tasted just average. I feel that menu and food taste need further improvement.  Overall, I would say just OK for short stay.

One of the highlight was that we can choose to have dinner in Vasco's.  What a major disappointment.  Yes, we understand that there's no buffet, however, the ala carte menu is simply disappointing. It was not worth the extra we paid. And the taste, it could be better for this h\u00f4tel. I could not even finish my pasta. It was that bad. Ordered a hot chocolat\u00e9, tasted like the instant version. Left a bad taste in my mouth.  I am not so sure what's with this package. Ever since we checked-in, this h\u00f4tel wanted to charge us extra. Lucky for us, we have our booking confirmation in hand, else they wanted to charge us higher. Also, in the restaurant, know your right that you can receive 25% off on food. They wanted to charge the full price. It was a mess. Don't get me started on the service.   Thank goodness for the pool. We had a wonderful time relaxing by the pool. It's really huge and that's only because they share it with the h\u00f4tel next door. I would say this pool is the highlight of our trip.  Can't comment much on the room. I had a suspicion that we are short changed because we took the package. The room that we usually stayed in feels larger.   All in all, be careful when you choose the 'Gourmet Staycation'. Don't put your expectations too high or you'll be disappointed. And know your entitlements. \u2026",

They stayed true to their commitment to make it safe and clean for their customers especially at this time of the pandemic. They also changed their protocol with their breakfast buffet, by providing you a schedule where you can have your breakfast, this way they would prevent overcrowding of guests in the buffet area.  Overall, it was a great short stay at Hilton, will definitely go again hopefully when the conditions are better.",

The rooms have been allocated nicely to our convenience. Due to CMCO,  we couldn't experience our breakfast and evening cocktail in the Executive Lounge. Both were served at the alternative restaurant and lounge bar.  The breakfast experience was alright. However, the evening cocktail services and food varieties can be improved especially at this alternative venue. Also, it is best to have a Hilton Honors counter for the convenience of the members. Overall, through my previous experiences staying in KL Hilton before, I am happy with the services and facilities there.  My special thanks to Mr Ikhwan  Shah, Rooms Division Manager for\u2026",

It's almost half of my room rate! Imagine that if I go out the next day or few days later? Does the hotel realize how nonsense it is?  At the first place there is no warning sign of using the Touch N Go at the parking entrance especially for the hotel guest that at least will stay for a night.

I hope the management remembers us locals who supported the hotel during these difficult times.  We stayed at the King Deluxe Plus room which is sort of a corner room with the lake, Parliament and Bukit Tunku view. Room is very clean and well maintained despite being almost 20 years old. Hilton is smart to brand and market their clean guarantee using the Clean Stay branding. Towels and robs were presented in a sealed box. The room was even sealed before our arrival...very much like how the papal apartments in Vatican City were sealed during sede vacante before a new Roman pontiff takes charge.  Separate bath tub and shower.\u2026",

Following the incident and after 3 calls, a housekeeping manager came up to our room to address the issue with the reason that the staff actually went to the wrong room.

During check in, you have to choose your slot. 3 slots available with one break for sanitize session. This made me feel confident that they really taking things seriously.  What can be improved :- They should apply the same format for the swimming pool. Pre determined the slot, limit no of people in the pool and allocate time for sanitisation.

The only downside is that it was crowded during check-in period that our high tea session was bothered by the running and\u2026",

With good food served and great hospitality given by both staff and management team, the whole family had an enjoyable and super duper fun lunch experience. Even our kids loved the food.   The Executive Chef came to say hello to us and they all surprised us with a Moist Choc Mud Cake to celebrate the July babies birthdays and my brother's 10th wedding anniversary with sister in law. Such a sweet gesture.  Thank you to Mr. Ikhwan Shah, Miss Lily as well as the whole team from Chynna Restaurant who had served us well. Appreciate it and definitely would return again.",

At breakfast the following morning, Vasco received a full house - yet manager Mr Sashi personalised his every interaction with us, and ensured smooth operations. Mr Ahnbu, who served us the ala carte buffet, was efficient and professional despite incessantly pleasing multiple tables. Covid-19 precautions were heavily emphasised throughout, including the contactless check-out option. Overall, we are really impressed. Kudos Hilton!",

As for the restaurant (Vasco), it was table service for the buffet which was an interesting concept, however, perhaps due to the lack of resources, we were not attended to when we require service.

Some things could have been better at check in, more informative about how things work in the apartment or at least the correct way to log onto the wifi. I put it down to new staff.  But we figured it out with the general instructions on the website anyway.   The apartment is clean and well designed and functional, everything worked well- top notch kitchen appliances- and the views were amazing on the 18th floor. I loved the toiletries too. The bed was super comfy and we fell asleep to an incredible subwoofed playlist with the KL Tower lights winking at us.   Facilities were great, no complaints.   Breakfast was good - it was served in-room due to the MCO and could have been served with less plastic but on the whole we enjoyed the meal.   The location offers lots of convenience with eateries and we walked to interesting neighbourhoods with some rare heritage architecture; had a lovely 10km morning walk in the vicinity with a satisfying swim afterwards.   The customer service is top notch. The hotel representatives did go out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Big shout-out to Mike for your generous gestures during our stay. We are eternally grateful.   And guess what- we\u2019re visiting again this weekend!   Highly recommended. \u2026",

They were accommodating, they made sure I had everything I needed at all times and there was always someone to help me out.  The pool was closed at first due to the pandemic, but they opened halfway through my stay and I was able to enjoy it, as well as the great cafe they have by the pool, which offers great options for food and drinks.  They were also kind enough to allow my cat to stay with me, and even arranged to help with my move to my new apartment.

The bedroom is facing the KL Tower, so relaxed seeing the colourful towers blinking at night while laying on the huge comfort bed.

Cereals, juices and coffee are free flow. The view from the lounge was spectacular!     You wont get hungry here, you can even cook in the room as the kitchen has all equipment from pan, plates, fork, spoon\u2026even equipped with dish washer.  We walked to the bar street down the street\u2026chankat bukit bintaang. Lots of choices here and further down will be jalan alor which we had local foods there for two consecutive nights.

It's centrally located and walking distance to Jalan Alor for wonderful food.  We had a nice view including the Petronas Towers and the two floor lounge at the top of the building was an added bonus.  It has all around views of the city from about 45 stories up so we didn't feel like we had to go to the viewing areas of KL Tower or the Petronas Towers for terrific views of the city.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  Highly recommended!",

There was a loud persistently annoying continuous noise all night every night!!    We couldn\u2019t work out where it was coming from.   But it seemed to come from within their own building system (either the vents, air conditioning system or something else).  Based on sleep deprivation I can\u2019t give it more than 1 star.  And therefore would not stay here again.    The cleaning staff were wonderful. You should always tip them daily.  They do a good job and workers should be tipped (in my view).  \u2026",

The bath tub & rain shower is separated from the toilet bowl and the basin, just at the overhead of the bed (comes with privacy glass function). Rain shower water is not bad (shower head could better), marbled bath tub is just nice. There's a small walk in wardrobe which is kinda cool, big enough to store luggages and your clothes to hang in.

I called every single Hotel in Kuala Lumpur and all they could say was fully booked with no intention of helping out at all. Anu is a man who truly cares for his guests. I salute you, Anu.

The breakfast was great but due to the Covid Pandemic, it has to be staggered to avoid overcrowding. The breakfast is great and with ample selection. Since only 2 time slots allocated, the wait time for breakfast can be a bit long. Maybe if there are 4 time slots of 1 hour each may help to cut down peak waiting time. The room was clean, comfortable and safe. The staff were great, very helpful, responsive and courteous. There were minor housekeeping issues but was speedily resolved by Duty Manager (Encik Hasli) and Housekeeping Manager (Puan Adi). The pool is nice too. Location is great, near to many tourist attractions and public transportation hub. For those who enjoy morning or evening walks/jogs, there is a nice Lake Gardens nearby. Parking is a flat rate of RM15 per day but need to be careful since sometimes it charges 2 per day which happened to us twice.

Needless to say this little incident was rather unsatisfactory as we made plans around Hotel Stripes (restaurant bookings within the vicinity that is walking distance) and being left in the limbo at the eleventh hour.   However Natasha Kok from Majestic's reservation did an excellent job in pacifying me and sorted out the room confirmation and ensuring that i was provided with the room and dining privileges on par with what i booked with Hotel Stripes. In fact, i would like to commend that she went above and beyond and exceeded expectations entirely in ensuring customer satisfaction. This happened to be my third stay with Majestic Hotel and it is their impeccable and exemplary services such as this that they will always have in my books as one of my recommended choice of Hotel for KL. Rest assured that you have my loyalty and return patronage.  Hotel rooms are clean and tastefully furnished although some deep cleaning and minor touch up should serve the hotel well since it has been operational for many years. Buffet breakfast has a smaller spread compared to pre covid times but it is adequate.  Doorman to front desk service were top notched as always. My compliments to the Majestic Hotel team.\u2026",

Rooms were big with one hall leading to another bedroom. Dinner set there was great with good ambience and attentive waitress and waiters. But choice of a la carte and price could be better.  Bed and pillow was so very superb I think that was one of the highlights for me.  No more buffet breakfast so , felt like lack of choice. As it was served in a bento set.  Swim pool at gym level was not opened ( I wished it was as it will be a good thing to be able to dip in after a gym workout )  Receptionists at check in looked very junior and less attentive.  Syed was one who served us well and Syarizal was very friendly and professional to chat with. It was very nice\u2026",

The complimentary (for club rooms) \u2018afternoon tea\u2019 is limited compared to the Grand Hyatt in KLCC, serving a few pastries and that sort of thing. Big perk of the club rooms is the 24 hour check in/out period - perfect if you arrive late at night and want to leave late at night. Also the complimentary unlimited laundry is a big perk (completely took advantage of this and ended up getting a full two suitcases dry cleaned.)   The pool is pretty\u2026",

Upon arrival, i was told that there will be no breakfast spread as the hotel restaurants are closed. Imagine paying extra for breakfast only to be given this news.

For the record, this visit was not our first stay at Majestic KL. As usual rooms were perfect, staffs were friendly and all the things are perfect!",

The room was comfortable but was not impressed that there were no views to speak of . Could not even open the shutters in my room . Fortunately we spent little time in the room . Other family members stayed in the new part . These rooms were bright and spacious . Enjoyed the club lounge snacks and cocktails from 5 . Buffet breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice .  Need to get a taxi really to go anywhere .",

Check-in was fairly straightforward and quick. The room was large and spacious with plenty of room for our luggage, and plenty of seating. Generally, the room was clean although we noticed, when sitting on the sofa, a brown stain on the bedsheet - at least on the edge, so we were not lying on it (see photos). Another downside was the clear glass panel separating the toilet from the shower. It reduced the size of the toilet headroom which made it somewhat awkward when sitting on the toilet. Both of us had difficulties due to this limited headroom - and being clear glass, it is not easy to judge the space. The breakfast choice\u2026",

Pros: once you enter the hotel, or the room, you do get the majestic feelings. I love it\u2019s history and the building entrance. My room was stunning to walk into especially the bedroom. Open space was big enough to have friends over or even gave a meeting.   Cons: unfortunately more cons - never met such unfriendly/unhappy looking receptionist, restaurant waiters. I travel a lot for work so as much as I appreciate the grandness of a guest room, I look for practicality- bathroom was nice but no place to put your toiletries. When you have lots of cosmetics, space to put them is what you need. I\u2019m not bothered about the quality of a tissue box but as you can see from my photo, needs to\u2026",

This hotel is not exactly in the heart of KL, however it is one metro stop away from Chinatown, 10mins drive from the core of KL, and Sentral train station, so it is still quite a good destination and convenient spot. The hotel is beautiful with great services from all the staff. Room was beautiful and spacious. Loved it! The only downfall is the pool areas. This is a massive hotel with two swimming pools, one at each wing. However, considering how big the properly is, I was quite disappointed in their outdoor patio and pool area. There's definitely room to expand for improvement. Aside from that I have no negative comments to provide.  I highly recommend installing the app Grab, which is southeast Asia's version of Uber.\u2026",

Half the time their gate does not work and you end up being stuck until an angry security guard comes and tells you you have to use a card . What if someone didn\u2019t bring a card .

So after I have contacted Agoda, they come back to me and tell me that the hotel refuses to pay back for the double booked room.   Well then, great! Thank you Oasia, you never be seeing me again.",

I did see a couple of spots in my room that need maintenance - they look like water damage and I suspect there\u2019s an issue with the pipes. Other than that, my room was great - clean & comfortable. Not much of a view as the window is so small and you can\u2019t really get to it to look out very far. The biggest let down for me was the pool area. The pool itself is lovely, but the pool furniture isn\u2019t great. It\u2019s all hard plastic, there are a few loungers actually in the pool, the rest are chairs & tables. I would\u2019ve liked sun loungers around the pool to make it nicer to hang out.

A very mixed experience: great location, roomy apartment for 4 adults, okay breakfast, lovely smiley doorman.  However, we had to ask to change rooms as there were rats making a constant scuttling and squeeking sound in the air ducts; the washing machine didn't work; the lift didn't work and we had to use the service lift throughout our stay, One night even this didn't work and we had to walk up the fire exit stairs. The air con didn't work in our bedroom, but was fixed after two calls to Reception.  However, the very worse thing (apart from the scuttling rats) was the manner of the Reception staff. They were surly, barely communicated with us and never once gave any apology for any of these issues. They\u2026",

Front desk couldnt really help with places to recommend to us to go for makan. They only have one standard pillow which is high n uncomfortable.

We enjoyed our 4 nights stay, the chambermaid cleaned our room and made the bed daily, top-up the coffee and tea. And the swimming pool and shower rooms are well maintain. We love this place. We stayed in this Suites last year 30th Aug 2018. And we will come back again. Thank you.",

We have to carry all our luggage and enter to the mall first because that is the nearest entrance for us. Another thing to mention is that there's is only one escalator connected with G floor and LG floor, which is very inconvenient. However, like I said, the hotel stay experience was great. Except a few stain in the bedsheet, the bed was comfortable. I like how the TV has the mirror screen function even though my room was not functional.

We had our cab waiting as we had plans to meet family for supper. All we needed was to freshen up a bit which Ian helped us with. Stored our bags in the office and got us access to freshen ourselves a bit so we could run back out as the room was being dealt with.

Check-in was a bit hectic because of an event in PWTC; a lot of people checking in and out. Lines were long. But I went for lunch as soon as I got there. 2 hours later, my room was still not yet ready. I booked for a Deluxe Suit, because of the long wait, they upgraded my room to Family Room instead! Yeay! Thanks SPH!   The buffet was great! The Mee Kari was unforgettable! I wish I had more room to stomach that Mee Kari! Haha! Will definitely be back for that Mee Kari. The Western Breakfast was my daughter's favorite. The staffs were very accommodating for a family with little ones like me.   I like that they followed the SOP in using the pool where we have to book 2 hours earlier to use it. But, when we were swimming, suddenly a huge crowd came rushing in. I doubt they ever booked their time to use the pool because it was surely more than 10 people at one time already. SPH should monitor closely on this. I force my family to go back to our room as soon as the pool got a bit crowded.  I did request for an extra laundry bag but it didn't come. I had to purchase plastic bags outside myself.  The lifts are superb! Though it was an old installation but it is very fast and well maintained. Good job SPH!  Other than that, it was a pleasant stay. Love it and will repeat again.

Its very convenient and the LRT access are just walking distance. Great stay in KL and if you're not planning to drive around.  The room is very comfortable, spacious with everything you need in the inside, the decoration is simple and nice. The staffs were amazing.   However, i would say that the check in process took longer than my last visit to this hotel. I was asked to move to another counter then another counter by the staff. And this does not make a different at all if i were to stay at the previous counter. Also just a little concern in regards to the room amenities - one of the mug has lipstick stain. Perhaps this could be avoided in future.  I am looking forward to\u2026",

The dinner buffet was ok, as it is MCO u have to wait for the staff to get the food for you, but some of the staff(the sushi guy) is slow in service (u stand in front of him for minutes, and he will just ignore you) yet some of the staffs( seafood guy) is friendly.  Room: The room was clean. Mine with twin tower view.   Departure: double charges my room rate despite I had already paid for the room.due to the entire experience I feel like I need to double check where I usually don\u2019t.

That's why I always go back to the same places because they never let me down. Traders Kuala Lumpur has a gem, besides the view, the Shangri-la expectations. Traders KL has gotten herself a wonderful duty manager name, Abby.  Abby is passionate, caring and she is always there for me, whenever I stay with Traders. Leaving a memorable experience for me and my guests. She will always go the extra mile to enhance the quality of customer satisfaction and give service from the heart.

The evening canapes and happy hour also meant we were able to enjoy some snacks and drinks before heading out for the evening. The view from our room was one of the most incredible of our holiday, being able to see the Petronas Towers lit up at night from the comfort of your own bed was spectacular, not forgetting of course\u2026",

You can walk there in five minutes through the park. Make sure you book a Petronas Towers view room.

Excellent service in the club lounge . Fantastic view of the towers from our club room which was spotlessly clean and modern and well worth the extra cost considering the daily complimentary 2 hour bar and snacks. A couple of things prevent me from giving the hotel 5/5 . The 'hot' options at breakfast were lukewarm at best and the food selection is geared more to Asian guests rather than Europeans. The air-con in our room was inefficient . However I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again and would highly recommend it .

The hotel provides a really useful (and free) shuttle service on a large electric golf buggy to the KLCC which runs every 10 mins or so and operates until 10.00pm (great\u2026",

We found that the main restaurant fulfilled our needs better with a wide selection of dishes. Our room was no different to any other similar hotel of this standard and we had no complaints about the room or housekeeping, everything matched our expectations.  We noticed in a previous review about the way guests using the Club Lounge during the early evening were misusing this privilege and basically having meal and drinking as much free alcohol as they could within the 2 hour period. The chefs were bringing out large platters of food that were presented in small dishes, but instead of taking 1 or 2 of these dishes they were taking 5 or 6 each and the platter was empty\u2026",

                "review_text": "My fianc\u00e9 and I had chosen to stay at your Hotel due to the location and distinctive architecture that features elements of the Malaysia\u2019s unique heritage. Being a third party agency here in China, my fianc\u00e9 can have a local Malaysian heritage and cultural experiences so that he can share his experience with the relevant parties here.   In the early morning of 26 January 2020 estimated 08:10hrs, I was about to leave the Hotel for reunion at parents, unfortunately, there was a high threshold between the bed chamber and bathroom, I crossed, slipped and fell down in the bathroom of room 455 due to slippery floor, caused my head to hit the ground injured the back of my head, with a lot of blood rushed out from the injured area. I remained calm and made a call to the operator to inform about my injury while blood was spurting from the wound. My fianc\u00e9 and I waited for someone from the Hotel to bring us to the hospital for medical treatment, however we were not able to wait any longer as I was seriously injured and my wound was bleeding, time is of the essence, I was conscious and able to walk down to the lobby to seek for assistance. There was someone from the Hotel came and checked on my condition and arranged a car to send us off to Prince Court Medical Centre without someone from the Hotel to accompanying us to further understand the condition. If this incident has happened to someone at my home, I could have been taken further steps to keep her / him accompanied. Being someone in the hospitality and tourism industry for almost 15 years, I truly believe this is very basic and necessary.  If there is a threshold installed, the edges should be sloped or have an non-slip surface and be adequately secured to the floor. This is important, as the person would encounter an unexpected, increasing the chances for a fall. Ideally, the floor surfaces should be consistent. If hotel guests understand the dangers of a wet bathroom floor, then hotel management must also know and thus take precautions to protect your guests by placing a rubber mat on the floor of the shower or bathroom to prevent skidding.   Slipping in the shower or tub is no laughing matter, bathroom falls typically mean violent contact with hard surfaces, which may result in head trauma, broken bones or even death. I suffered a serious head injury when I fell, I may still be dealing with the after effects such as headache which I do encounter such symptom sometimes.   During our stay at your Hotel after this incident occurred, none of the employees from your Hotel taken effort to check on my condition, not even a simple call or to leave a message in the room. When we approached the front desk to call for the duty manager for a meet up, we had been asked by the staffs repeatly what purpose was that for while there was bandage around my head, which I felt it was a total negligence from the Hotel.  The response from the Hotel was slow during the follow up process which was due to limitation of movement and documents searches, which I completely understand, nonetheless, it took almost half a year. I thought there would be a fair conclusion after a real long investigation by the agency, unfortunately, the conclusion is \u201cthere is no insurance coverage\u201d.   None of the insurance agencies had contacted me throughout the 'investigation process\" and the case closed just by sending me a message via WhatsApp without an official response via email.   We loved the location and ambience of the Hotel and we did considered your Hotel as one of the venues for our wedding ceremony next year, nevertheless, we will not proceed further due to bad experiences.\u2026",

Thumbs up to this 1st impression gave by Ms. HAYATI.   Room was enormous & spotless clean. The downside are housekeeping didnt clear up the minibar, dialled no.1 from room phone to get housekeeping to clear it for me & a male operator working night shift on 4th Sept asked me to clear it by myself (whattt????????)  The water conditions during my stay was not really ok. It\u2019s not hotel\u2019s fault. Whole Kuala Lumpur facing water supply problem due to shutdown of main supply tank. A maintenance guy came to checked & told me duty manager (5th Sept 2020 1230am) will come within 10 minutes time to check on my room condition but nobody show up.   Pros:  1.

The pool was large and nice. There is no longer a view of the twin towers from the hotel. The gym was tiny but adequate. The club lounge is very nice and not many people choose to use it.

You can still get all the usual stuff so don't worry  Rooms are very spacious with a nice big bathroom with separate walk in shower and bath. The staff are amazing, efficient, polite and helpful, never had any problems at all. I can't believe some people said they were unfriendly! Maybe it was your attitude to them that was the problem. A nice smile and a hello goes alot further than snapping your fingers and bellowing at them. They are employees not your slaves!

Room was pretty big and had a small patio with a view over the pool.  Bathroom was also well-sized, so no complaints there.  I was able to use a spare keycard to keep the aircon going while I was out, which I was very happy with as it was quite noisy when it was on full tilt.  3.

Additionally and as given a feedback o this before, the aircon was sickly locked at 31 deg C which is not an acceptable hospitality standard, and this was even way higher than our normal room temperature. It took 6-7hours to even reach 27 dec C and couldn't be adjusted further. This is once again unacceptable as it is an enclose area and 27-31 deg C is not fit for guests and will cause unnecessary suffocation/heatstroke.",

The staff are super nice. From counter to restaurants. Helpful and always smile. On last day, building aircond is haywire, but the staffs handle it well. Although you can see their stress level as they cant give any definite answer. Anyway thank you for still entertaining us calmly at 3am.",

It's very fast crowded with lots of hungry people once again. You can't even get a hand on the food if you don't force yourself in.  5. WiFi in the room is very slow.

So for me this meant a trip out to try and find a cash machine and then having to get change for a small enough denomination for the machine.

At 10 pm after I had dinner from Starbucks, I came to the hotel lounge to have a seat while I was on a call with my girl friend. Mr Sunder and employee of the hotel as a receptionist was smiling and I wanted to give him chewing gum after handing him it  he complimented saying I was handsome .After coming back to my seat few moment later he comes to where I was seated .He then touched and squeezed my leg.After I was done talking to my girlfriend  I wanted to go into my room. As we were only provided with one key card for both me and my father I wanted to ask for another so I won\u2019t be disturbing my father who was sleeping inside. When I went to ask for another sunder asked me inside his room , said he practiced ayurveda and started touching me .

Breakfast is basic.   Except their good location at Bukit Bintang, all other factors I rank 2 out of 10. I won\u2019t be back!  I checked in at almost midnight from overseas trip and by the time I showered and settled down, it\u2019s 1am. Then I realised the air cond is still not cold so I requested technician to check. He came and asked me to wait for 20mins for it to get cool! I told him, it\u2019s alredy turned on for 1 hour and if\u2026",

Receptionist/front office staffs not friendly (seriously they need to smile more. If they hate the job, they should consider getting another job). Bed is seriously short, i am 170cm and my feet already reach the end of the bed so sometimes my foot hanging outside the bed during sleep. I specifically asked the 2 rooms i booked to be located at the same floor... it didn\u2019t happen. 1 of the room i booked should be triple room instead, the hotel gave me double bed with extra bed laying on the floor (matrass only)... not nice!",

Initially at reception the guy and a lady manager were suggesting us to go for 2 big family room which looks like a dormitory...How can they even suggest when we paid for 6 superior rooms. Later on after so much discussion with a lady manager ( she was nice person , listening And cooperative) they have upgraded 3 rooms out of 6 rooms. The food was pathetic. When we complained about it, she told us that sorry, I didn't went on inspection today, as we have many guests\u2026",

The location of the hotel is perfect, very near to the Berjaya Shopping mall, eleven(supermarket), restaurants, Starbucks, Jalan alors( The food night market) and the famous night market \"Chinatown\".   Our room was cleaned everyday and the housekeeping never touch any of our belongings.   We had a problem with the wifi though, a bit weak connection at around 11 p.m most of the day.   Each and every staff of the hotel were very friendly and helpful.   One small problem, that I would like to\u2026",

The breakfast also good. But they only give us one key for one room, just incase how if we go separately and cannot get in touch each other? One of cannot get into room if the others not yet back to room. Just improve it for the hotel good. Overall this hotel is good, will stay here again next time. ",

Reservation department was very good, checked with me a couple of times regarding my bookings. My last email to the reservation department was to request for early check-in at noon as well as special requests for higher floor and a room facing away from construction sites or a close-up building.  Morning of my check-in I called up to Front Desk to check what time I could check-in. Was told my room would be ready for my early arrival.   CHECK-IN Room was ready and check-in process completed quickly. Room assigned was however not satisfactory due to its view being blocked by a nearby building. Thus, I called down to ask for a room change to another view. Reception (Margaret if I\u2019m not mistaken) offered to show me another room and we were brought to room 2430. It had a better view (not so blocked off) and it was also bigger. We gladly moved.  I was pleasantly surprised due to some reviews mentioning the apartments being dated in comparison to the hotel rooms. Actually the photos do not do justice to the actual room. The photos make the room darker. It was in actual fact, more cheerful.  My room despite being quite plain, was cosy and nice. Bed was comfortable and big. Kitchen well equipped and bathroom complete with all toiletries. A lot of storage. Excellent hot water and strong water pressure. The only thing was I couldn\u2019t alter the temperature of the air conditioners. MEALS Club floor benefits like Afternoon Tea and Cocktail Hour were served at the Junction, which was right by the lobby. It was ok but still a pity since I would have loved the Club Lounge. Afternoon tea consisted of 2 types of sandwiches, a savoury bakery, 3 types of pudding and fruits. Hot drinks as well as freshly squeezed juices like orange and green apple. As for Cocktail Hour, you get drinks like wine, beer, above mentioned juices, soft drinks and hot drinks, 3 types of canap\u00e9s, cheese platter and fruits. On both days Sue took very good care of us. She was friendly and always made us feel very welcome, and regularly checking if we wanted anything replenished.  Breakfast was quite limited, just American and 3 Asian breakfasts. However, we could order more than 1.   FACILITIES  Due to MCO many facilities were not available. Gym just reopened. Went to check it out but didn\u2019t utilise. Nicely air conditioned. There were towels and bottle waters.   LOCATION Excellent, so close to Pavilion Mall.   CHECK-OUT Was pleasantly surprised to find out that the front desk staff had accorded me a late check-out till 5pm without me asking for it. Love it!  In conclusion, would I return? Yes, definitely! Especially once the Club Lounge reopens.\u2026",

The jacuzzi pool needs better maintenance: water was dark green and the water jets are powered off before 1pm, presumably to save money. Dark green water = not chlorinated, not clean. Eek. Service in the restaurant was top notch. Kudos to Tommy, Sue and team in Sedap Restaurant. Food was excellent. Seriously. Like caviar!

When I questioned the staff on duty all she told me was - it's just a deposit we will refund without any justification.  Wil not be back for sure ",

TQ  Setbacks:  1) The hot shower didnt work in our 1st day and ended up showering with cold shower :(  2) No KLCC view 3) Very small pool and the pool bar was closed 4) Major setback! Pullman customers were no longer allowed to use the pedestrian bridge that connecting Banyan Tree hotel and pavillion! Its the same group of hotel, but very different treatment. It will be awesome to be able to use the bridge so you wont end up wet walking few more hundreds\u2026",

Check in was quick and smooth. We did have Premium Deluxe room (honestly was expecting bit better upgrade being Platinum Accor member) which was very nice newly refurbished on higher floor with nice views and all modern amenities.

Master bedroom is kinda dark and just plainly furnished. 2nd bedroom is small and comes without tv. Staff is nice and engaging. Dont bother take the breakfast as the breakfast location for hotel room and apartment is different. Breakfast for apartment guest is a joke. Nothing much. Only few items and tasted meh. Other than that the hotel offer a great value for money",

There was construction going on within view but the room's large viewing window it didn't bother us at all. The room was very spacious and modern, well done up, and the bed was comfortable. There are USB points so there's no need to bring an adapter to charge phones, nice touch. Wifi was good too, good coverage and fast enough for Youtube, etc. Everything looked great until the evening. When most of the lights were out that's when the first roach sighting happened, on the side of the bed. Thought it was a one-off thing so we didn't think much of it. But\u2026",

My second bad experience was the limited room facility of this historical hotel.  My advice to the visitors is to bring sufficient personal grooming materials.

Walkway to the room was dark and stuffy,I mean what happened to walkway air-conditioning. In short, the room was not welcoming at all. We decided to shorten our stay to one night, but your manager in-charge won't agree and kept forcing on penalty. She gave us an upgrade stating all your rooms are fully renovated which gave me scare to think your level of renovation is. Again  the upgraded room was better but adding to our  disappointment  we found a used face mask on the sofa. Where is Seri Pacifics\u2026",
