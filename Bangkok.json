My staycation here was perfect since I arrived and checked in with the Japanese guy and Maggi until I checked out. I do really love the room and view, bathroom is amazing decoration, lighting and marble. Breakfast was so damn good with all you can eat a la carte order menus. Thiptara thai restaurant is also nice for dinner :p",

                "review_text": "I never tried Peninsula Bangkok in the past, in part because many big hotel chains in Bangkok often offer generous benefits to elite members of loyalty programs consequently Peninsula is possibly not the best fit for me.  However for a change in scenery I tried it for the first time to broaden my horizons.  My stay was pretty much in line with my expectations: the strength of the hotel is polished service, the upgrade was slim to none as I am not a repeat guest, and the hardware is aging but still in decent condition.    I booked the entry level room and at check-in I was told we received an upgrade to a deluxe room but it seems from the website that the deluxe rooms are the entry level rooms.  The size was acceptable for luxury standards at 45 sqm and I felt all areas were relatively spacious and evenly distributed.  The river views were great as can be expected when booking a room in a riverside hotel.  It is very clear that Peninsula used to be top notch luxury and well ahead of its time several years ago because many features are still aligned to what many newer hotels have today, for example electric controls for blinds and curtains, bed side electronic controls for \u201cdo not disturb\u201d, air conditioning, lights, etc.  There was even a TV in the bathtub which was probably quite rare when the hotel opened more than 20 years ago.  Some equipment was from a bygone era for example the printer / scanner / fax machine in the room \u2013 I do not recall ever having a fax machine with my own fax number in the room which could have been quite useful for business travelers many years ago.  Even though the hotel is not the most recent, I found the furniture to be in good condition, not many scratches, overall very modest wear & tear, and almost no stains on the carpet or sofa.  The shower also had great water pressure.  Bathroom amenities were Oscar de la Renta from Gilchrist & Soames which had a very nice scent.  The mini-bar and snacks were complimentary except for alcoholic drinks.    Breakfast was not a highlight of the stay but if my stay had not been during the busy weekends I might have had a different experience.  It was entirely buffet-style and there was no a la carte menu, not even a small one so that was lacking to qualify for luxury standards.  Also guests were all going to the buffet without being provided with plastic gloves as a covid precaution like what some other hotels are currently doing.  That said the main problem was not the food but rather how crowded and hectic it was without enough staff.  It was not even clear where the entrance was; there were signs instructing guests to wait to be seated but no staff to actually lead people to a table.    My expectations for service were high and were generally met \u2013 I found service to be excellent and polished especially doormen in traditional uniform at the entrance which gave an immediate feeling of luxury upon entering.  There were other instances showing their service-oriented roots, for example when they saw I was pregnant they asked me if I wanted a special body contour pillow without us having to ask, and also asking me if I preferred in-room dining for breakfast due to the pregnancy which was a nice offer and in retrospect we should have accepted.  Nevertheless service was not perfect due to the situation in the restaurant as mentioned above.    Overall the hotel was ok although due to the age of the building I am not sure there was enough that stood out for me to be wowed.  In normal years where we want to renew elite status with hotel loyalty programs, we will probably not be overly interested in paying a premium to stay in the aging Peninsula considering the more generous benefits offered by hotel chains such as room upgrades and free breakfast at Waldorf Astoria, Park Hyatt, and St.Regis to name a few.  I am not against returning but of all hotels we have stayed in Bangkok I would probably consider Peninsula as average, some being better and some being worse.\u2026",

The King was upgraded to a vast suite on the 32nd floor at check-in (without asking) and the double was connected. The half-board rate including breakfast and dinner. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by Khun Henry who set the high standards from the start and remained vigilant to our needs throughout the stay without being intrusive. Thank you!  Breakfast is at River Caf\u00e9 & Terrace while the dinner we have a choice of one of 3 venues, the River Caf\u00e9, Thiptara Thai Restaurant, or the Lobby restaurant. Elaborate chocolate amenity setup twice in the room. Our rate was for 1/2 board and the food was sublime! Rooms were clean and comfortable and everything was in good working condition. Our kids had a blast at the pool and the comped boat service which still in operation (unlike the nearby hotels) was very convenient to take us to Iconsiam or Sathorn Pier (Saphan Taksin).   Awesome stay and the highlight of our 2-months Thailand trip. The  service, the views, the food, the amenities were all great. Very charming and luxurious place throughout - highly recommended!\u2026",

To then get it already sitting in the room on our arrival was quite awkward (one day ahead of her birthday).

They have the Thai Thiptara restaurant and the Riverside Cafe open both were excellent as usual. The breakfast lacked the wow without the full buffet open but it was more relaxing being served at the table. We enjoyed our dinner at the Thai Thiptara restaurant.  The room (we are upgraded to a corner suite - thank you!) was as great as always. The bathroom is always a delight. These suites are charming heritage style if you like super modern these are beginning to look a tad dated compared with the newer offerings along the river from The Capella etc But the Peninsula still has my heart! The Peninsula has the best part of the Chao Praya river. Our package\u2026",

Our personal highlight was the shuttle boat service - a convenient and relaxing way to travel to Icon Siam or across to the Mandarin Oriental. We told them it was our wedding anniversary and the hotel had a cake waiting for us in the room - that was nice. Bizarrely, despite booking a king bed, we were given two singles, set together closely. Its our 10th anniversary, not our 50th!  Amenities are pretty good.

My room was full of smoke smell. And during check out reception asked me: Were you smoking? I told no... and it is from air con. Definitely not pass new normal standards.  3. Breakfast i would say very simple. Even no bacon. Coffee machine not set up properly and can make only espresso shot even that it is still need to press several times to get it done. Staff just chatting in reception area of entering for breakfast.  4. Nobody measure temperature when enter\u2026",

Practically next door to Union Mall and MRT. 7 11 in front of the hotel.  Really quiet.  The only disappointment was Check out. It was slow. Took me 15 minutes. FO staff allowed guests to cut in. Nobody doing anything to perhaps make the process faster such as ask the room number of guests in advance and send information to housekeeping to check.  Other than that a great stay.",

Sure, not everyone's experience during their stay here is going to be the same but I think you'd really have to be searching for something to criticize to not enjoy yourself. The rooms were spacious and decorated in modern chic. The gym is fully functional proper gym. The pool is a rather nice size and presents a very comfortable area to lounge around.

We booked a hotel car to take us from a rather long and disappointing KLM flight. The driver was wonderful and drove beautifully in his 7 series BMW.  Whisked staright to our suite where check in was carried out in seconds.  Jet lag ensued so we had the most wonderful room service.  Pool area is a little small but very neat and tidy and did not get too busy.  Great gymn with all the machines required.  Breakfast is simply stunning with such a wide variety of international and traditional Thai food.  We ate in Saffron twice but could have eaten there every night.  We did have reservations for Vertigo which were cancelled due to high winds.  All in all we simply cannot\u2026",

Alas, having just stayed at the new Marriott Marquis on Sukhumvit Soi 22 and the Marriott  in Hua Hin, we realised how spoiled we had been in those new and fresh hotels.  The Banyan Tree is set back off what is a very busy road, with not much close by.  It is surrounded by high rise office blocks, so not a particularly convenient or interesting location.  When driving into the hotel, you have to go behind the building that is on the road. When you get to the drop off area, it is very small, un-inviting and with no doorman waiting outside. At first, we thought we had inadvertently arrived at the service entrance to the hotel.  The doorman, singular, was ok but not\u2026",

The chief concierge Khun Jackie, with his epic service, he handsomely upgraded our room to one-bedroom suite which was very spacious with everything so fresh and clean. They also offer various kinds of complimentary tropical fruits.  Our children love it so much that they wouldn\u2019t want to go anywhere else.   The Moon Bar at the rooftop is a very special place to visit with a nice scenery where we could spend time to relax and see most of Bangkok beautiful landscape from the top view in both\u2026",

While the hotel has stunning views and large sized clean rooms, it is definitely not a luxury property-more like a 4 star hotel trying to  masquerade as one. During check-in at the tired looking lobby, we were greeted by a receptionist who appeared to be in a sour mood. After we requested for an upgrade to their new Serenity Rooms, she lied to us that these rooms weren't available on weekdays and refused our request for late check-out. After showing another staff that these new rooms were indeed available for booking on the hotel website, a kind duty manager granted us the upgrade as well as our request for late check-out.

He was so enthusiastic and helpful staff. In the first place, we booked at Vertico moon bar, unfortunately rain on that day, so we moved to Vertico Too restaurant on 60th floor (Also stunning view).

My girlfriend and I decided to spend a couple of nights in the comfort of  Banyan Tree and it turned out to be something above and beyond our expectations.  Starting off with a double upgrade to a 2-bedroom suite, for two days we have been pampered with all the hotel amenities by the exceptionally attentive and kind-hearted staff.   The suite was a film-style, dreamlike gem with all the comforts we could possibly imagine, from the bathtub to the in-room dining service to ensure an unforgettable staying.   The health club and the swimming pool welcomed us during the drizzling afternoons and we surely loved our included breakfasts and the fabulous Chinese dinner on the 59th floor.

                "review_text": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate the Valentine\u2019s day. One of the main reason to choose this hotel on this special occasion was that we wanted to see by our own eyes the magnificent view over the Chao Phraya River, described by many guests for a long time.   Although the property itself was a bit old, the other parts, comprising to become this hotel were just perfect in terms of its location, room, food and staff\u2019s services.   The hotel was situated along the Chao Phraya River, the main river in Thailand, flowing through Bangkok. Getting to the hotel by a car or a boat was the most convenient way as it was a bit far from the Bangkok Sky Trains or Public transportations. The Icon Siam, a huge and luxury department store was the right opposite the hotel. There was a free shuttle boat service to the Mall from Sri Phraya Pier, where was within the walking distance.  We stayed on the 20th floor in an Executive Suit room. The room was divided into two main parts i.e. the living room and the bedroom and it had old-style built-in furniture, but clean and well maintained. Once we got into our room, the housekeeping team had beautifully prepared something special from folding towels and flower on the bed. Views from the two rooms were a bit different. While the more lively and busier river view could be seen from the living room, the quieter view with no high buildings alongside the river was seen from the bedroom side. The property\u2019s location and the room\u2019s position allowed us to enjoy the stunning views of the River not only during the daytime, but also the colourful lights from the Shopping Mall and several river dinner cruises during the nighttime. Such enchanting atmosphere absolutely gave us a memorable picture from the stay.   We were so impressed by staff and their awesome services at every part of hotel. Before the stay, the Reservation team, especially Khun Kae and Khun Air had amazed us by their friendliness and support. On the arrival day, once we stepped into the hotel, we had been greeted by an energetic concierge, who led us to meet Khun Pannate, the Assistant Front Office Manager for checking in. The way she served us showed her professional and polite manner. Although she was wearing a face mask all the times, we could feel a very warm welcome from her smile and charm under the mask.   Moreover, Khun David, the lounge manager and the staff at Giogio\u2019s restaurant including Khun Bew, Khun Ice and Khun Na were very active and energetic, although the restaurant was packed. There were not so many selections for breakfast, but some Thailand\u2019s street-food-style food such as stir fried pork with basil leaf was wonderful. We could not be happier than savoring the moment of having good food, sipping a glass of wine and watching the moving lives along the river during the sunset and sunrise time here.   In conclusion, this hotel is definitely well worth returning more and more.\u2026",

I called Feb8 and tried to complete the payment process, but I was told the quota was full. Same thing happened to my booking with another Marriot hotel. I was put on waiting list in both cases. Feb11, the other Marriott hotel informed me the payment link and my booking was completed successfully. There was no news from Sheraton in between.

The staff are friendly, helpful and attentive, the location outstanding, the room (Executive Club Suite) was good, the breakfast outstanding and the hotel very clean.   The management team have managed to maintain a very high standard of covid safety and cleanliness and not, as many others have done, used the pandemic to drop their standards whilst maintains their prices.   Bravo to the whole team at the Sheraton Royal Orchid, for making our stay the most relaxing and enjoyable experience across all other brands and we will\u2026",

Although, it is an older building, it is well kept and its location is perfect. With river views and easy access to Icon Siam and Talad Noi, it was perfect for a little escape. I would highly recommend securing a club room as you have a bit more space, view of the river and the club perks. The customer service was great and the breakfast - while not huge (understandable given COVID), it was clean and had a decent variety of food for everyone (including my vegan husband). The only bummer was the construction at the pier, which ruined the relaxing atmosphere at the beautiful garden pool, but I am sure the Sheraton could not do anything about that. All in all, a lovely\u2026",

The guest rooms, always an upgrade as titanium level member is a welcome and additional joy.  Spacious and with great rooms facing the river.  Thai style accessories make the room warm and comfortable.  Spacious bathrooms and comfy beds with quality linens and pillows.  All the room amenities you could need.

To have gardens and peacocks around a beautiful pool with a swim up bar and comfortable sunbeds - especially after a long flight is delightful.  The location is still great with fantastic views of the river from your room and the outside bar and lap pool.  The boat to take you to the sky train and the river bus right next door make it so easy to get about the city.  Highly recommended.",

We cannot possibly say enough positive things about this hotel. The staff was incredible. They were beyond friendly, went out of their way to be of support and service to us, and were extremely professional. Nimit was wonderful for our family and regularly had conversations with us and our son during our comings and goings. Another staff member made a paper airplane for our son one afternoon while we waited for dinner to be delivered. From the concierge to the front desk, from the housekeeping staff to the wait staff at breakfast, we could not have asked for more.   The breakfast was delicious and offered great variety. We ate each morning outside by the river\u2026",

I then called room service only to be told off that they had never received an order from me. Then I spoke to the manager and the order came 15 mins later. What I received was just\u2026",

Also the lounge staff was very nice  and they asked me about my needs and filled them in every time. One thing I want is that official Facebook messages or official email replies are slow",

We love travelling up and down the river on the boat busses. 15 baht each and great fun. We've stayed on the club floor every time and sipping cocktails on the 27th floor watching the sun set on the river is still a magical experience. Prices remarkably good. Two lovely swimming pools by the river.  Only negative is hotel restaurants typically expensive with bland food. But a couple of decent places just outside and taxis very cheap to get around in. ",

It took 30 minutes from the airport.(8pm) The staff was very polite and friendly. The room was large and very comfortable. The bathroom was dated but a staff told us that they are expecting to have renovations in the near future. Hopefully they can update all the bathrooms. The dinner at Thara Thaong was very nice! The complimentary boat services were very good. We didn\u2019t use any transports on land. I wish we could have stayed a couple of more nights and spent more time around Bangkok. We would recommend Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel to our friends and family! ",

We absolutely love being on the river and have shared many holidays with family and friends here, as well as travelling just as a couple.   The old staff are always welcoming and genuinely interested in how you have been.  However, we have never witnessed such a steady decline in service as this hotel has over the past five or so years. We used to receive a personal letter from the Manager welcoming us \u201chome\u201d - gone. We used to receive a fruit bowl with lovely tropical fruit - gone.  In May last year we received 2 apples and in December 3 bananas! We used to receive a certain amount of complimentary laundry each day - gone. Children weren\u2019t allowed\u2026",

Sat at night simply watching the world go by and then realising I simply must get some sleep !!! Staff were amazing and helpful. Breakfast buffet was very good with lots of variety. We ate late on arrival at the lounge bar on the ground floor and the food was averagely priced as well as the drinks for such a high class hotel. The grounds were very nice and although being in central downtown Bangkok the swimming pool Area and gardens are a oasis of calm and relaxation. We had a great stay also the shuttle boat is handy every half hour to cross the river to the Siam shopping centre and then onward to the nearest sky train station. The hotel is also conveniently\u2026",

The Sheraton seems to cater mainly for Chinese Tour Groups, thus the guests are not in a 5 Star range. The hotel ambiance is overall middleclass, lobby more a Tourist-Mall ambiance, rooms and public areas are worn and shabby, so are the pool areas. Do not get me wrong: If you are expecting a 3.5 Star hotel you will be happy, but if you have ever experienced true 5 Star hospitality in one of the many truely fabulous Bangkok hotels you will end up very disaoppointed.\u2026",

The breakfast is a huge international buffet and can be enjoyed outside on the terrace or inside.  There are 2 pools, good for cooling off after a day's sightseeing.  The hotel is walking distance from Chinatown and next door to a jetty where the river taxis stop so easy access to the main old city sites and also the leisure complex downstream.  The hotel has a free shuttle service linking it, the shopping mall IconSiam and the BTS station. An e all rooms have a river view, river taxis and long tail boats during the day and the brightly lit party boats at night.

The fresh water pool is full of kids and flies as there's no wind here, but the saltwater pool has neither and is a great tranquil place to be. Sound proofing in the room isn't the best so if you're a light sleeper and want to sleep in you might be woken up in the morning. Hotel staff is awesome, except for the lack of smiles in the bar downstairs they all were very smiling and service minded.

A modern and sophisticated hotel offering numerous outlets to wine and dine as well as 2 roof top bars.. wow!!  I especially appreciate the amazing location next to Emporium Mall and just a small step to the sky train that can take me anywhere in Bangkok in only a matter of minutes.   The staff were very friendly and I even had a opportunity to speak to their helpful General Manager Markus.   I will definitely be back and recommend highly!",

Next night rooftop bar choice of 3 cocktails no Margaritas and not so special cocktails so nice glass of wine instead shame they had a different cocktail choice.The staff in every department were excellent and very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was a la cart good choice and delicious. We loved our stay and will return in the next few months.",

If you stay here I recommend not eating here. Pool and gym were nice. A couple of the machines were out of order in the gym. They have a huge selection of cardio machines and free weights.

I spoke with the manager asking for nothing more than another room with working aircon, simple right.  This guy was unbelievable, he told me I could stay in the room for another 3 hours or leave and they will try and fix the aircon.  If that didn\u2019t work they would look into another room.

The aircon was a bit noisy and was louder when at night where surroundings is quiet. Toilet drainage seems to have problem. The glass panel at bathtub looks like a high risk possible accident. The side of glass is fixed to the wall, but the bottom of the glass panel is not. Hence, if someone accidentally hold the glass panel as support, it could break\u2026",

Stayed in a suite. Suites were fine but felt a little bare although they had all the expected amenities. Adding some colour/rug/cushions and a few little touches of luxury/comfort could really take things up a notch, but this is not a criticism at all just an observation. Had a pleasant stay with good service. V decent breakfast and overall much better value for money than Emporium suites in my opinion if you are looking to stay in close proximity to Emquartier. Would stay again,\u2026",

As a matter of fact , Ihad been fascinated by this fabulous hotel for its convinient location very close to the entetainment area in soi 24 , very close the Bts skytrain and very cloe the luxurious shopping mall , so since that time I decided to take this hotel as my sole option and never ever think of moving other hotels . Every year I used to stay atleast 2 or 3 times in Skyview hotel with\u2026",

Then we got the key, went to our room and while we were relaxing the housekeeper try to open the room door with only one knock and open it immediately but we use a double lock inside so she couldn't get in and realize that guests are in the room.

I got upgraded my room to be two-bed-room suite. For the couple travelers, I totally recommend this room. You got the bathtub with the spectacular view of Bangkok. The bathroom was huge, clean, and new. I gave extra point on the big mirror in the bathroom. I loved this place and I will totally come back. The breakfast was also great, various choices and located on the 22 second floor, breakfast with a view literally. Rooftop pool can beat all the five-star hotels in bangkok; you will get all the 180 view of bangkok and it was real relaxing. The staff here is super friendly especially Nat, she is helpful and also the manager. 10 out\u2026",

The room was clean and there was a lot of storage space, most probably for business guest staying a little longer than us. We did not have the breakfast, but heard it was good. There was a pool on the roof, which had a nice size and a good view over Bangkok.

The manager Ms Tommy was nowhere to be seen after numerous requests.  Finally we were told she had gone to head office for a meeting leaving the poor front desk staff to deal with the problems!  There wasn't one manager available to make or take any decisions, we found this very strange.  A reputable hotel would have at least contacted each guest and even offered some kind of compensation even if it's a free drink.  The manager never did contact us before we checked out and I doubt she spoke to\u2026",

I love chilling out at the Cooling Tower roof top bar. A well design comfortable roof top bar with a stunning view at night. The staffs were super friendly and helpful. Fantastic service and attitude! I also enjoyed the Tuxedo caf\u00e9 at the lobby. It has a nice and casual ambiance. A good place to relax and enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning\u2026.

Housekeeping provided the little extras (water, tea bags) that I requested.  The one maintenance problem (need to reset the A C fuse) was dealt with within 5 minutes).

The room was great , clean, beautiful,stylish and comfortable, with a very good-smart home system and beautiful city view. The hotel is located in the heart of Bangkok, so it is so convinient to get to all shopping malls.  The hotel also provides 24-hour fitness center. The food was delicious ,clean and good in quality , I surely  recommend this hotel.",

The receptionists were friendly, and my appreciation goes specifically to Khun Jane who took care of the check in as she was so attentive. After checking in, we went to have dinner at Tuxedo Bar. The beef bourguignon was top notch, and the bar staff, Regade was so polite.   The hotel is baby friendly, there was enough space beside the luggage rack to put the baby trolley in the room, and they were kind enough to provide not only the baby cot but also a baby bottle sterilizer and a small baby bathtub.   The view from our room on 23rd floor was stunning. This new luxury hotel is definitely worth a try.",

A sweeping & spacious floorplan; classic yet contemporary design features and, most resonant, a feeling of familial hospitality which competitors often struggle to achieve.

Bathroom was a good size but towels were well worn and although clean need replacing soon room had a nice large bed and excellent bed linen and very comfortable with efficient a/c.  Lacking a well placed sockets in fact the only one we could use was under to shelf so had to take the kettle into the bathroom (only twice did housekeeping replenish 2 tea bags). Room was clean but in sadly need of refurbishment and balcony needs a deep\u2026",

As with our numerous stay in this hotel over the past few years, it was pleasant and when without any issue. Nevertheless, we notice that ever since UHG took over the hotel management services, the service provided by the front desk was less personal. Moreover, we did not see any of the long-serving staff anymore.",

We returned after 2 hours and found a clean and comfortable room, dated and chipped but with a bathtub and an opening window. The pool was not spectacular and really cold, but big enough and there where some sunbeds. while yhe location is good we will try another hotel for this price next time.",

There is an awesome dining precinct right across the road called Coco Walk with several great, affordable Thai restaurants and bars. I recommend one in there called Thai Town, the food was excellent and drinks were strong. As it's a big main road, it's best to go to the Ratchathewi station, go up the big stairs, across, and down the stairs on the other side, in order to cross the road.

Money changer, atm and massage parlors is also walking distance. I was lucky during that period there is a street food stall right outside the hotel. No shortage of food choice.

It was a good promotion for the price. We had a two bedroom corner suite on the same floor as the pool which was very convenient. Being relatively new, the hotel is clean and modern with a stylish pool/ bar area. Breakfast was good, if a little limited, but the lunch we had was a little disappointing. Another downside was they only issued one room key and this stopped working a couple of hours before check out. It was quickly resolved, but not ideal when you\u2019re trying to get your kids showered and changed after swimming,  Staff were friendly and helpful. We\u2019d definitely stay again if they ran a similar promotion, as the hotel is in a great location.\u2026",

The room has been recently renovated and is absolutely stunning; much more glamourous and interesting than it looks in the photos. The lounge was open and we enjoyed sandwiches and cakes for afternoon tea, and cheese, fried rice , (awful) tempura vegetables, and quite a lot of booze during the evening.  It was my partner's birthday so the hotel gave us a cake and the lounge staff organised a 3pm check out, both of which were amazing- thank you! Why only 4.5 stars? The hotel charges a \"tray charge\" of THB60 to bring ice to your room. This is so nasty and is a money making technique akin to a boarding-house, not a 5 star hotel. What's more, I had already paid a 10% service charge on  which is supposed to close at 11am but come 10:30am is again, starting to close. I understand that staff want to go home, but for the same reason a guest would be denied service if they arrived 15 minutes late, the staff should not clear away 15 minutes early. Additionally,the reception ladys need a few days of customer service training. They are a hard faced crew who would be more suited to work at a prison than a hotel- a \"hello and \"how are you\" would be better greetings than \"passports!\" and \"credit card you book with!\"Again, this has been mentioned in quite a few other reviews but as nothing has changed, it must just be the culture  of the hotel. Sadly, the pool area is an utter mess. I understand they are renovating but that does not excuse empty glasses and bottles discarded on the (ripped and stained) sun loungers. Finally, the boat service is still not in use \"due to covid\" which is a little silly as all the other hotels and the local authority have their boats whizzing around and I can assure you, the hotel is busy enough to warrant the service. The steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi are also either out of service \"due to covid\" or because of renovations- the staff I asked couldn't remember which excuse to give me so gave me both! I suspect that both the boat service and the sauna etc. are actually closed to save money. However, in spite of some of the strange rules and lacklustre service, I will return to this hotel. \u2026",

In the evening i had buffet dinner at hotel, food was ok, not so much choice, but what is bothering me is some staff at food station they are talking each other with some swearword, there are still some customer at the restaurant, never expected i will heard that from 5 hotel. Also never sit outside next to the river again, been bite alot by mosquito.  On my last day, my bf wanted to surprise me by sending a bouquet of flower for me to my room but\u2026",

The shuttle boat not on serviced, as a five star hotel located by the River i believe its essential to keep this service to attract more people and compete with other hotels  2. The pool is lack of maintenance, many dirty mark and also u can find some dry bird dirt on the mattress   3. It is the smallest 5 star room i ever had. Its like holiday inn level (you can even see the fridge facing you everytime wake up in the morning)  4. The cleaning service is not the best for 5 star hotel.

This was not our first time at this hotel and with the quality of the rooms with spectacular views of the river, the food in the restaurants and executive lounge and the welcoming feel you get from all staff members you come in contact with is why we'll be back again. I'd like to compliment the people who work in the executive lounge as they are some of the most welcoming, efficient and friendly staff we've experienced. There are a couple of trainees who fit in perfectly and they'll ensure this high standard will be maintained. We look forward to our next visit.",

The reception staff were efficient and friendly. We booked a Premier One Bedroom which was extremely good value. The room has a kitchen with fridge, stove, micro wave, with plates abd utensils. If you need anything else for the kitchen just call Housekeeping. There was a sofa and coffee table and a good sized flat screen TV, as well as a desk and lamp.The bedroom has a comfortable bed, safe, and wardrobes. The bathroom is a good size with toiletries provided. Basically it is a serviced apartment. We didnt have a view, just the building nextdoor, but higher up you would, or at the front or rear of the building (we were on the side). We didn't have breakfast, but there was a promotion going which made it more than reasonable. There is a very good gym, and an \"L shaped\" pool that wraps around the rear of the building. The pool is deep compared to many Thai pools, and refreshingly cool. We had an issue getting the channels on the bedroom TV. We rang reception and someone came up and fixed it in 5 minutes. All requests to reception were handled promptly. Parking is available. Like a lot of Thai carparks the headroom appears low, however we have a huge 4wd car and managed to park without any problems. The rooms are spotlessly clean. If I were looking for something to criticise I would say that some of the furnishing is getting a bit worn, but not to the extent that it looked bad or I wouldn't want to stay there. I would say given the very reasonable price for the room (and there were several room types cheaper or dearer for that matter), the size of the room, 2 TV's, cleanliness, the kitchen, pool, and parking--that Siri Sathorn is a hotel I would happily stay in again.\u2026",

It was WAY more expensive than many other of our choices, but seemed worth while.  The staff was very friendly, the food at the restaurant was really good. Unfortunately, the room was DISGUSTING. Every time I entered the room, my allergies flared up and I spent several miserable nights trying to sleep. Additionally, 75% of the horizontal surfaces covered in fabric contained \"stains\" of the biological variety. It made it very difficult to relax in bed, or on the sofas, or window seats. We attempted to contact management about our concerns during our stay, and were never contacted. My husband, my daughter and I could've chosen much better for much less. I WOULD NOT recommend this hotel.",

The ensuite shower/bathroom was nicely appointed and always plenty of hot water. Only had breakfast on our first morning - it was very good with a huge choice, just didn't feel we needed a big breakfast with all the food options Bangkok has on offer. The staff are all lovely and the doorman in his traditional costume was unfailingly jolly, and the room was kept very clean with fresh towels every day.

The hotel provides a free shuttle every 30 mins (do check when they begin and end though) to either of these places if you don't feel like the 10 minute walk.

Toiletary fittings are Toto brand, and toiletries are a good local brand (cannot remember which one exactly). That being said, the toilet bowl did get clogged during our stay (flush was quite weak before and after the clog, not as strong as I am used to), which maintanence team fixed quickly.  Breakfast: We opted for the room package with breakfast inclusive. The breakfast is buffet style, with a relatively average spread. Enough to fill the stomach, but nothing to write home about.  Location: Short walk from Thonglor BTS, directly beside Hotel Nikko (which might be a better landmark for Grab or taxi pickup / drop off location). Taxi driver from\u2026",

                "review_text": "I have been booked to stay at FuramaXclusive Asoke on 20 - 21 Mar 2021 which was booked on Premier room. I already informed in my booking via Agoda system that I may check in at 13.00 pm on 20 Mar2021.      Unfortunately, when I came to check in at 16.20pm. I was told by Khun Kitikun Kongsak that my booking was not presented yet. I had to wait for a few minutes. Then while I was waiting for the check in process, I had a call to contact Agoda customer service to check why this situation was happen with me. at 16.30 pm. while I was on the process to discuss with Agoda, Khun Kitikun just shouted that \"\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e04\u0e49\u0e32\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e46\" from the counter check-in. This was the first unacceptable behavior of a professional customer service which the counter and my sitting was not that far why he did not walk to contact me but he did shout instead.    After I have finished a call with Agoda, I walked to meet Khun kitikun at the check in counter. I guessed he might hear what I have discussed with Agoda staff. He stated to inform me that why I have to wait with a strong voice. In additional, he also asked me that Do you still want to stay at FuramaXclusive Asoke? Was these a right sentence to ask from your customer? Oh My God, it was increased my angry and temper. In my mind, he might forget the professional behavior of Customer service by starting to apologizing for my waiting. Then I also had a temper that why he did not apologize to me for the incident with cause me to waste for pleasant time to enjoy the service of FuramaXclusive Asoke. I asked him why you did not start the conversation by apologizing to me first. Khun kitikun still used his strong voice tried to explain to me again without the apologizing or say sorry.     Then I knew that I could not talked with him anymore due to the poor and unprofessional training or your property for an excellent customer service. I asked to talk with another in charged manager but Khun kitikun still arugued with me that he was the one who in charged as Duty Manager. I raised my voice that \"\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e39\u0e14\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e33\u0e19\u0e32\u0e08\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a.\"      Good luck that Khun Jakraphan Canti who already saw all incident made the decision to take a position replace Khun kitikun. He started with the word \"\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e17\u0e29\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\" which is a professional customer service while handling with customer. Unfortunately, by that time Khun kitikun still had temper and tried not agree to step back from the situation. He still tried to talk with me with his temper. Fortunately, that Khun Jakraphan have asked me to move from check in counter and sat at the waiting area. Khun Jakraphan apologized to me for the unprofessional behavivor of Khun kitikun moreover that he explained that it may have been some mistake from the booking system. Then he explained how i could enjoy the facilities of the property.   This email will not happen if Khun kitikun started to have a conversation with me as \"\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e17\u0e29\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\" and he sould not ask \"Do you still want to stay at FuramaXclusive Asoke? Unfortunately, may be because your hotel was lacked of the proper training for an professional cutomser service or Khun kitikun did not had the proper training enough to handling with the customer. This situation made me feel unpleasant to stay with your hotel.       This will be the last time that I would make a booking to stay with your property. Not only for the old furniture and unproper taking care of old equipment as the attached picture but also the terrible accepted manner of your worst staff as Khun kitikun Kongsak who is a Duty manager on 20 Mar 2021 at 16.20 pm. By the way, in case you may want to know I have a 10 years experience of Airline business and 4 year of hotel business from Accor and Hilton. I could say that I have never have a worst and terrible staff as Khun kitikun Kongsak. This was the first time that i made my decision to stay outside Hilton brand and it made me clear that why Furama still be only 4 rating stars hotel because of your unprofessional staff as Khun kitikun Kongsak.\u2026",

                "review_text": "I've stayed at this hotel from the Last 12 Feb until the 6th of March (Booked until 10th of March), I've stayed this hotel for 18 days, the staff doesn't know I'm staying guest or not.   Well honestly, I don't really care they know me or not. As you can see attached pictures, the dust from the Air-conditioning drops every time I go out and comes into the room. Almost 10 days, I've wondered where it comes from and totally surprised when I check the Aircondition on the Top of the room! Fully dusty and it is ready for a drop.   I've totally annoyed and went to the Front Office at 9 PM, I've asked the staff in English and show the dust and pictures. He tried to listen, I did apologise also because the dust clean should be directed to Housekeeping, not Front Office.   I've asked him that, today HouseKeeper came already and cleaned the room, why isn't she clean well? have I not put enough Tips for makeup in the room? Is that the reason why I'm staying in this room? He answered \"Totally\", I think he doesn't understand what I've said, so he said \"Totally,\" I was completely ready to explode but he apologized after a minute of my silence.   This hotel has really bad and slow wifi, I'm using a mobile hotspot every time for my work when I stay in the room. The wifi disconnect every time with really poor speed.   If you willing to use Netflix? Please go to another hotel, when I checked in this hotel the Front Office said that \"we don't serve for room clean when I answered I'm long staying guest, they answered back, Will arrange 1 time clean from 2 days. But will change towels and water every day.  Even I gave the tips for that as well.   Few staffs are nice at the Front Office, Food and Beverage staff are  robots, only 1 F&B staff greeting without emotion and others don't even care about guests. They are really busy selling food outside of the hotel. It seems like not enough many people buy it.   If you are willing to sell the food on the street, just open a street restaurant! What a waste of great venue with a great location.   I will never return to this hotel. Shame, Poor Service, Poor Management.\u2026",

All they have in the buffet it toast, salads (for some reason) and an open bowl of yogurt. Even the tea and coffee wasn\u2019t replenished quick enough and people had to line up for it.

The location, at the interchange between MRT and BTS is ideal and it also happens to be close to my favourite tailor.  Soi 21 is a busy street and the area is crowded with skrapers. Hence, tiny Furama Asoke does not look very impressive from the outside.  The interior will not impress you that much either. The place has several of years of active service by now and is in need of renovation here and there.  Hence, if looks is very important to you, go someplace else.  What is good with Furama Asoke, next to its superb location, is its small scale, usability and the personal service and welcome you get from the staff. At this place the staff actually remember you and take care of your needs. Young Mr Dong and\u2026",

The bed is very comfortable that provides us a very relaxing sleep. Location is very near to the MRT. So its very easy for us to take train from/to airport. The buffet breakfast is good we enjoy it. The staff is very helpful and friendly as well. Taking grab from this hotel to khaosan road and siam paragon is quite cheap also coz its not too far! There is a pool at the rooftop but its seems like a jacuzzi for dipping but its not bad! If you are looking for a great value and comfortable hotel this hotel is a great choice! Will definitely book this again when in bangkok!",

They have a standing shower inside the bathtub which for the matured adult would be a challenge getting in and out. They still used a shower curtain and single sink in the large bathroom. For strange reason, they only have one side table at one side of the bed only. The breakfast variety was poor and limited in variety. The food quality was also not so good.

The hotel appears to be of a high standard based on pictures posted online, however some of the rooms are dark and dingy, and in need of refurbishment. Some floors are still smoking, which added to the dingy feel.   We hated our first room so much that we paid to upgrade to a refurbished room-  and even then I found the general state of these better rooms to be shoddy with broken fixtures, bad refurbishment and patch jobs. The workmanship didn't seem up to the usual Accor standard.  The hotel is located in the busy siam square area, surrounded by plush malls, so excellent for high end shopping and restaurants.",

First: it is smack in Siam Square, which is bright and busy and safe; with ample restaurant and shopping options; and a hop and a skip from the Siam BTS Station -- with links to practically the entire city. Second: the staff are just lovely. ALL the staff, from concierge to restaurant to tour serviced to housekeeping -- every single one will bend over backwards to help you. I have turned up way before check-in time, departed way after check-out time, and if a room is not available they always provide somewhere to shower/freshen up; and the lobby sitting area is wonderfully comfortable, with isolated cosy spots that allow comfort and privacy.

The double bed is very comfortable but it was up against the wall so the person sleeping there would have to exit the bed at the bottom assuming there are two of you sleeping in it. The furniture consisted of one small settee and a small coffee table and that\u2019s your lot. But as the saying goes you get what you pay for.

The price, in fact, was greatly reduced due to   the COVID crisis, and I got a free upgrade the day I arrived! It's a kind of business-style hotel, and the rooms are fairly spacious. The place is in the heart of Sathorn, down a small alley and surrounded by the chaos of the city, not far away from the BTS. The staff was helpful and welcoming, and addressed any problems I had. I think for the price it's hard to beat at the moment. The only negative thing I can think of is the free newspaper in the lobby -- it's (Chinese) propaganda!",

The breakfast is like in many other places where it is a bit cheaper, there are not so many Western products and more Asian dishes.

From the pictures the hotel looks fancier than it actually is. Also, some of the pictures posted on tripadvisor are wrong, the actual dining room is the one with the orange and blue chairs, not the fancy one with wood chairs and sofas. It's a very standard Hotel, but being clean and quiet it's good value for money. We booked a room for three people but, when there, we were told we had to pay extra for the third person's bed and breakfast. Maybe it was our mistake when booking?

Our room was upgraded with a living room and an extra bedroom. Very spacious. I wanted a kitchen so I can cook simple dishes but only the smaller rooms have a kitchen. I think they should make a bigger gym. It was so small. We had to book at the nearest gym for a month although we stayed in Bangkok for only 10 days. And because we go to the gym, we really need a washer and dryer in the room. They have a laundry space but with only 2 washers and 1 dryer so we had to wait for the others to finish in order to use it. They should provide baskets to put finished laundry just in case the owner doesn't pick their laundry on time so others can use\u2026",

Awesome decoration in fact.   The room was great. Spacious as well. It had a nice couch and a recliner sofa. The bed was comfortable. The balcony was facing the highways, not a bad view either.

My 3 stars are because I was counting on using the shuttle frequently but it sees to be \"broken\" more often than it is running.  Also, the pickup and drop-off rules change with every driver and every person answering the phone!  Meaning when you want to be dropped off at the bts station its okay....then when you come back they can't pick you up from the same place they dropped you off at????? Doesn't make sense to me.  They make you walk half way then they pick you up.  What is the point of having a shuttle then?  Other than that the location is fine.  If you want the red light environment its close enough to walk to.  If you want to avoid the red light then you can take 2 different routes.\u2026",

They have a new building, regular rooms and deluxe, the old building is regular and junior and booked once with a junior suite, but was shocked by the old furniture and the air conditioning is hot, the maistahl are always booked in the old building, either the new building has new words, new rooms and new furniture and the hotel is close to metro and shana nana As for the\u2026",

We stayed at this hotel because of the positive reviews, but I am starting to think if these positive reviews came from real people who really stayed at this accommodation.   FIRST ISSUE:   The hotel is very hard to find on your own. We came from the BTS station and our phone\u2019s GPS cannot really find the place.   SECOND ISSUE: The hotel is located in a red light district. Why we didn\u2019t realize this prior to booking was our fault. But if you are a family with kids, do not stay at Nana!!!  If you are someone who wants peace and quiet , do not stay at NANA!   THIRD ISSUE: The hotel has two separate buildings and our room was in the second, newer building. This building has no gate or security and anyone can just access the elevators.  \u2026",

Huge minus for safety reasons as we saw stairs/fire exit was completely blocked by pillows, mattresses etc. in the first floor (used as some sort of storage). Thus, blocking the only way out in case of fire. Simply not acceptable.",

The hotel is quite a distance to walk to the train station but we do not mind as the hotel provides a free shuttle service on demand up to midnight.  All employees are courteous, cheerful, attentive and helpful.    The price is very reasonable for a spacious room which includes buffet breakfast with a reasonable spread of food. the room is equipped with a small kitchenette with a microwave oven which will appeal to business travelers on extended stay. We will definitely stay at Alt Hotel when we visit Bangkok again.",

Nothing wrong with that, but I would prefer not to be in a hotel that\u2019s primarily used for sex tourism. Questionable stains all over the beds. Disgusting. See attached photo.  Rooms are otherwise nice. If you\u2019re here specifically to use for the sex tourism, then this is a suitable spot for you. ",

The room itself was all right but there was a constant air draft even when the aircon was switched off, so I ended up catching a cold. Bad thing is   Hotel is split up in 2 buildings and have a small pool area and a very small gym . Makes the place feel kind of boring. Lot of adult entertainment down the soi 4 road , place is pretty at night , but in daytime it's a place I don't like to be , very dirty and smells bad . Tuktuk drivers chasing you all the time , stay away from these hustlers, they want you no good in this part of the city. One night it knocked at my door , outside was a old Japanese guy standing completely drunk with a dwarf sized girl they was on the wrong floor I guess.  Pretty fun , but not a place\u2026",

The hotel is clean and had everything you needed for a short stay. Breakfast had a good variety of food, which slightly changed each day. The hotel is only a few minutes walk away from lots of bars.

Upgraded my room, great breakfast, good service with their tuk2 to the main road. Quite swimming pool, comfy bed, friendly staff need to be highlighted! They let me swim when the pool supposed to be close at 10 pm.   Only 10 mins away to bts nana. It's not holiday if you don't want to walk right? 10 mins actually is nothing, but mostly you can get the shuttle tuktuk from the hotel.  Definitely will come back to this hotel if am in Bangkok again. ",
