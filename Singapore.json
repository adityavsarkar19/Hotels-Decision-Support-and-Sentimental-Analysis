                "review_text": "Thank you Fullerton team for taking care of us. Rafi guided us to wait for check in. It was surprisingly busy but their Q management was superb.   Mira is so sweet. Assisted my partner and I swiftly for check in. She is very detailed and went through our benefits thoroughly.   Our room came with club benefits hence after check in - we proceeded to the club lounge, served by Norish who is polite and graceful. Unfazed by the crowd, the club team did such a good job ensuring that all their guests were taken care off.   My partner and I were also very amazed by Mr Roszel. Firstly we met him at the lobby assisting check in. The next time we saw him at the lounge during evening cocktail, serving guests, making the effort to know all his guests and even took the time to speak to us. We felt really well taken care of.   As for the room - it is meticulously well maintained and of course being a heritage hotel - the decor is old school but that is where the beauty lies. The bed is so comfortable!   My partner and I are very pleased and felt very recharged which is the main purpose of the stay.   Kudos for the Fullerton team (i am sorry i could only name a few) & their passion in their job. Thank you for all that you do and please stay safe!  \u2026",

This place has such a great view and facilities to offer however it wasn\u2019t that which makes me leave the hotel at the end of the stay feeling heavy hearted !! It was the staff !! There are so many small detailing that I have observed that every each one of the staff in this hotel would make sure they do their very best to make sure you feel like home . One of my best favorite was uncle Toh Heng who most of the time under the hot sun making sure everyone gotten their towels and water by the pool yet so smiley :) !! What is unbelievable consistently that I would like the world to know about is our care taker Miss Olivia !! Traveling the world encountered with many care takers there is something very special about this girl that make her stands out from most in the world!! Well Done for keeping the hotel image to the highest level !!  I can also never thank you enough to Ida, Sivan, Kumar and the brassiere team, Ummar, Rhea, Julian, Vanessa, Michelle, Thong, Asenth, 3 boys at the front arrival that I promise to make an extra effort to continue memorizing your names in my future visit , Uncle Toh Heng and another uncle that we met who bring us water and towels in the gym .... All the best to all of you , may god bless you all to be healthy and safe always and you will always be my preferred hotel !!! \u2026",

                "review_text": "My entire 4 stars go towards Warren Naluz Claudia and the Fullerton team, including the Indonesian Lady (Powder Room), all concierge, some men in suits who i presume are from upper management who bothers to greet guests at 9 in the morning. A small exception would be this short hair lady who only greets her specific guests/client/corporate people.  -1 star because the management took it away from the staff. Severely understaffed. Every other component is a 0.  *advise that all guests lower their expectation to avoid disappointment and management to take this review very seriously*  Breakfast: (basically this is where if there was a negative review function i would employ)  I saw a european family basically gagging, im sure your executive board or upper management is definitely made up of some Caucasians, please let them undercover boss the breakfast, they will gag. Waffles taste like kids playdough. Need I say more? Economical fried beehoon disguised as 'wok-fried vermicelli' i give credit to whoever who came up with this, I. clap. for. you. had a  good laugh.   Porridge, i have to quote Gordon Ramsay and say that both the chicken and seafood were rubbery.   Almost everything at breakfast was Not prepared in-house, so so blatantly obvious, in fact I can tell you that the guacamole tastes EXACTLY like Avofresh which can be bought from Coldstorage. Waffles confirm NOT made in-house, dim sum looked colourless, like deadfish, eh no those like food in the display case that has lost its colour from lighting. (go to yi dian xin or imperial treasure,  its like night and day) I dont think you need a customer to teach you that the eyes eat first. Fried chicken that accompanied a few dishes such as the aforementioned vermicelli, taste so stale, like it was made a few days ago.  The only 2 dishes, from the breakfast that purportedly costs/is worth 49$, the laksa and the rice of the nasi lemak(ok fine sambal can eat) were decent, but thats all, coffee very diluted, did i mention that the wait time is like 20-30mins? Ala carte order from staff. They give you some delifrance-esque bread/pastry basket to wait in the meantime.   49$ for entertainment for how disgusting your food is, hmm not even worth it. Basically breakfast was largely inedible.  Tried basically almost(didn't try the muesli) the full breakfast menu but seriously, it was underwhelming.  Check-In: Check-in too about 30mins to 1hr, YES THATS RIGHT. THE FAMILY BESIDE ME WAITED 1 HOUR TO CHECK INTO FULLERTON.  To add injury to insult after waiting to long, they give you a goddam teddybear and expect you to light up or smile or something. Is this a childcare?  Honestly just leave it in the room as a *surprise*  also, most of us have bags to carry, we dont need an additional promotional bear for the moment.  After finding out more, realised it as because they are severely understaffed, don't blame them, blame the upper management/hr , the staff probably has, poor promotion/renumeration. How to retain quality staff???? Also, can try to anticipate if you have a hike in bookings/popular periods right? first day ah? At least courteously inform your guests the day before to expect a long waiting time, minimum right??? or email/all up your guests and offer them maybe a staggered/earlier check time to ease the queue and load on staff? seriously do i need to teach you this radical new concept????? You can ask/remind your guests to do the pre-arrival stuff(book gym/pool) while waiting.  Honestly after learning more from the concierge/general staff, i feel damn bad for the staff. Special shoutout to Warren Naluz, Claudia and entrance(red carpet) staff. I hope all of you get a promotion/pay increase 24month bonus yall deserve it, really top notch service. Top-Notch service from Warren Naluz, hope he is part of the Golden Keys. Please nominate him.  Room: Pass, just basic everything there lor other than that nothing much, can say that they lack attention to detail, disappointing for Fullerton, see attached picture. Don't expect anything unless you book a 4-figure per night room.  Construction work on the 2nd floor lasted for about 1 hr, say goodbye to after-breakfast naps, was staying on the 4th floor. Again, thanks for the entertainment because I thought to myself, WHAT A JOKE FULLERTON. No notice/Letting your guests know, would have been nice? YA?  Pool:  Safety hazard, visited a few times and on ALL occasion, the steps were very wet, if you have elderly/fragile/clumsy/children PLEASE DO NOT RUN. 8am/9am, 12pm/6pm the steps leading towards the pool were dripping wet. Workplace and guest safety issue obvi. Please do not wear the hotel slippers there.  Pros: Bathrobe was good, luxuriously soft material. Near Asian Civilisation museum if you need to dump your kids somewhere.  TLDR: NO Fullerton magic or experience, its basically any other hotel. What a shame because it is such an iconic location and building. SIGH. Please go elsewhere for breakfast. Before they fix these issues I suggest you re-discover sg elsewhere. It isn't something that the CS(Customer Service) team can do/enhance, i think problem lies with management/board/execs.  Learn to balance your international clientele with the local one, form what i can see, you're not trying at all.(except your ground operation staff) hotline staff terrible, say call back but dont call back, any remarks you've left for them to convey are pointless, it is not followed through.\u2026",

It would be nice if there were like fake plants instead or given to another courtyard room with a little bit of privacy where nobody could stand directly outside the window looking in.

The only positive comments I have about the hotel is the  grand lobby, the generous size of the room and the lush greenery.  Room was not ready when we checked in at 3.00. Only got our key to the room at around 4.15pm.  Unable to give us a late check out to compensate for the delaycheck in.  In my view, this is not the service one expects from a brand like the shangrila.  Room was a bit dated but that\u2019s OK as room was reasonably clean. However the kettle in the room did not switch off by itself. We only discovered the defect when we realised that the kettle had boiled itself dry! Poor QC? Could be a potential safety hazard.

It was definitely much safer by hygiene standards, though the service was slower. Also, they have implemented a booking for usage of the pool which is better to ensure that the number of pax is manageable, though this meant that you may not necc be able to get the pool at your preferred time. overall I enjoyed the experience  and especially the massage! :)",

The poor service started when we tried to book restaurant reservations for lunch and dinner over the 3 days. The hotel staff was adamant over the phone that all restaurants were fully booked despite us having $200 dining vouchers for use. However there were a lot of available slots when I personally went down to the restaurants.  On the first night, I was able to book The Line restaurant and we proceeded to order ala carte. We then waited 1 hour for a simple spaghetti and meatball dish. When asked why it took so long, the waiter informed that a overseas flight landed so they had to prioritize SHN travelers. The reason did not make sense!  After 1hr 15mins, we gave up, told\u2026",

Breakfast at the Line was also great with the usual choices of breakfast regulars. If I may suggest though to include the drinks I.e. coffee and juices in the online menu ordering system as in the third and last day of our stay we decided to eat outdoors instead and it took us sometime to be able to find someone to help us get our coffee and I had to go indoors after sometime and find another someone to request for the same coffee before it finally did arrived. I think there are more staff indoors than outdoors hence the delay.\u2026",

This is by far the worst stay mainly Because Of the poor hospitality by the frontline check in staff, ZILA. As the first person we met and who attended to our stay,  she was hostile, unfriendly and unreasonable. It is the first time I\u2019ve encountered such frontline staff, from shangri la nonetheless. Could the management seriously look into Zilas conduct as she totally ruined my staycation and this has never happened before for shangri la. Intend to also report her conduct to management too. This is a pity because all the other shangri la staff service was top notch and it\u2019s A Great pity that Zila was the first person we met and unfortunately due to her, totally ruined the staycation experience.",

The staff and level of service they offer are unmatched in Singapore - just amazing (a great team all round, so attentive and big shout out to Nora and Raja for making our experience perfect). Valley wing luxury and services are just wonderful.  Room, facilities, F&B, Spa are all excellent.

He got to do gingerbread cookies, play at the buds indoor playgrd and the splashzone. My son had such a great time.  My husband felt the room was too dim. I also felt cleanliness was acceptable but could be improved given the high standards of shangrila.\u2026",

When we did the booking , we had tough choice to book with or without balcony as both of us are clueless of what we gonna get...    Deeply appreciated on your team who assisted us on our booking...

We arrived for check in early but were attended to promptly by Mr Abhi who was very professional and helpful during the process.   The ambience at the hotel was good. The personalised welcome message on the TV screen when we entered the room was a pleasant surprise and nice touch on the part of the hotel as well. The 19th floor room also gave a good view of the cityscape.  The gentleman on duty at the poolside bar on the afternoon of 14 March was also friendly and professional. Would like to take the opportunity to also commend the kitchen staff for whipping up a great dish of truffle fries to go with the Tiger Crystal.  Unfortunately, we cannot say same for the complimentary breakfast at the Edge where the food was bland\u2026",

Many thanks to Quam for his meticulous and humble hospitality service.

She still can ask me wanna change new bedsheets or not... really kind of extra foolish question. As she changes it after my answer is Yes. After all its my 1st time to choose staying this hotel. For such simple mistake. it's really gave me kind of feeling I won't want to recommend my contacts to consider choosing this hotel for rooms check-in. It's kind of very sensitive issues for this Covid 19 period that my sleeping bedsheets that have someone's hair left over.",

Equipped with a highly updated sound and lighting system, coupled with 2 huge LED screens, the ballroom is set to be a dream venue for any couple out there.  But the most important feature which actually made our wedding experience an unforgettable one was the staff of Orchard hotel. From day one of the ballroom viewing, to the food tasting and the wedding day itself and at checkout, Haze and Mun Kiat who were the sales and operations personnel attached to us, ensured that our every need is attended to. No stone was left unturned. They, together with the banquet staff during the wedding reception really bend (bent?) their back backwards\u2026",

Only setback is hygiene of room was not up to standard.

Can\u2019t help but to wonder if room was even properly cleaned and disinfected before the next occupants\u2019 stay. Pantry area where the kettle was, was also filled with visible dust. Please upkeep to maintain the 5 stars hotel standard. Unfortunately, we forgot to snap a picture of that thick layered dust. ",

At 8.45am there was a queue, and only 1 hostess to settle payment and bring guests to their table. Once I was seated, wifi was given immediately and she left without explaining or giving me the menu. At 8.59am, I asked a lady manager, on how we are able to proceed with orders but insisted that I was not able to order till its 9am. She mentioned that there will be someone coming around to take our orders. However, at 9.15am, no one came to the table. At 9.20am, me and my friend managed to get a waiter's attention and gave our order and we were given the \"complimentary snack\" a mushroom quiche on the table without any drinks?

Queue was pretty long at check-in but i was glad that there were 6 staff handling the process and beverages were offered to guests in the queue.  Fitness Centre was chic. Love the concept. The machines were among the latest, very user friendly.   Room was chic. Quite modern and pleasing to the eyes. The closet and minibar very nicely hidden. The shower cubicle was a bit too small. It fits 1 person. Bathtub was pretty shallow but was good. There is a water dispenser beside the tap. Great idea but.. you can't fill up your bottle or the one provided in the room because, the dispenser was short. You can use the glasses provided on top of the minibar.  The coffee table in the room was nice. However, the chair was super uncomfortable. There is no work or business table / chair so the same chair had to be carried to the TV console to do work. Very uncomfortable. I am short at 1.63m in height and i guess someone taller might be in a worse state.  Air-con was great. Can be controlled and stayed at the desired climate.  Wifi was good.  The power plug by the bed was not working. The power from the USB port at the same point was pretty slow. I waa lucky that i brought my travel charger and charged my mobile at the tv console area.  Balcony was great by no shelter so it does get wet when it rained.  TV channels were... so-so. I was quite surprised at the number of channels. Not impressed.  I looked through the in-room dining as i wanted to get some cakes. No desserts in the menu.  Overall, i thought more could have been expected for the price the hotel charges. I get more for the same price at a nearby premise.  \u2026",

Firstly, the stay at the hotel and secondly, the wedding experience.  -Stay at Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay- The hotel is newly renovated at our time of visit. The urban rooms were nice and cosy and we had an unblocked view of MBS. The amenities provided in the room was sufficient and most of the housekeeping/ room service requests can be done via a QR Code by the bedside.   The bridal suite was equally good and equipped with 2 bathrooms, one in the main bedroom (with bathtub) and another in the living room area (no bathtub). Only feedback is that the wardrobe is too small for the amount of attires we had (3x wedding dress + 1 gua). Sunlight was good for make up.

As we had a wedding to attend at the Singapore Flyer, ParkRoyal Marina Bay was the first hotel we thought of, due to the convenience.     The check-in process was very smooth and we were assisted by Mr Prem who was on duty that Saturday afternoon.  Mr Prem was very courteous and helpful. He even upgraded the room for us, from Urban to Lifestyle King, Room 1237, offered a late check out and even went the extra mile to give us a courtesy call to make sure that the room we stayed in was spacious and that the view was gorgeous. Indeed it was!  We applaud Mr Prem for his attentiveness and\u2026",

Starting from the check in, the staff gave us an electronic queue number that we can check online so we don't need to wait in line. I find it very strategic and modern. When we reached our room, we are in awe of the room's ambiance and the view in the balcony is magnificent! The room is very clean and smells nice as well. Few minutes after we reached our room, the room services knocked to deliver our extra mattress. When I examine the room I found this awesome toilet. It's very huge! We just noticed one thing, the downside is, there is no bidet present in the toilet so it's quiet hard to you know, wash after you use the toilet. I hope the management would consider adding bidet inside the toilets considering it is a must and also the hotel is a 5 star hotel without bidet. Nevertheless, we had a great dinner at Lavo, The staff there are very approachable. In the morning we did a morning exercise in the gym. The gym equipment are high-end. After we hit the gym, we planned to go for a swim but it is quiet hard to make a reservation for the pool so we had to wait for a while and wish for our luck to get a slot for the pool. Sad thing is, we can only use the pool for an hour. By the way, there is a store beside the pool and I would like to commend Ms. Lina for assisting us in buying our stuffs. She is very approachable and hands on to guests.

Worse is denied having rooms at the same floor. So whats the point of having a stayca when rooms were so far away. Explanation given were MBS rules for COVID Prevention. Do not understnad why total of 5 people allowed in 1 room but having room at the same floor not allowed. Worse is Manager Kenny did not gave a professional explanation but blamed it in the MBS regulation. MBS really need to review their rules in allocating room. Such a fruatrating and diaappointed staycation. ",

Booked a premium room with city view. The room size was huge,so was the bathroom with separate standing shower room and bathtub.  Family with younger kids or babies will love it because you have ample size to park your gigantic stroller and large space to open your luggages.  However, they do not have brushing kit or brushing mug for kids if you forgot to bring one. Bathrobes and slippers provided a upon request. (shouldn't that be included in the room since they know there are kids checking in?) Not to mentioned about having a stool for your kids to wash their hands or brush their teeth.  A big bathroom does not necessary provide you with more\u2026",

                "review_text": "I was looking forward to this staycation in this heritage 5* hotel, and booked a Junior Suite for myself, my husband and our son.  However, the experience didn't live up to the price and the expectations one has for a luxury hotel.  The hotel suffers from a dated set of facilities, some extremely peculiar recent interior design decisions, patchy service and questionable cleanliness.  Whilst all of these things might be acceptable for a 3* or 4* establishment, they're not when you're paying the kind of prices Goodwood Park charges.  Being in a lovely heritage building, you'd expect some old-world charm to the hotel, and the building exterior is very pretty. But, heritage of one thing. Dated and old-fashioned is another.  The Main Pool is very antiquated, and a bit forlorn looking.  A few sun loungers are scattered around in long, unkempt grass which surrounds the pool, flanked by tired and shabby paving. The child's pool at the end is particularly neglected, and the discoloured tiles make it look like the water is dirty.  The smaller Mayfair Pool is much prettier, and very pleasant. However, both pools lack facilities. There's no changing rooms in either, nor any toilets. To access a toilet, you either have to go all the way back to your room, or to walk through the restaurant or lobby to use the restaurant toilets. It's a very odd set-up and rather off-putting.    But the rooms are what is most baffling about this hotel. We booked a suite, and had high hopes, especially since the website states that they were all refurbished last year.  However, its clear this was done on a very tight budget. The living area is spartan and lacking.  Bizarrely, despite being a large room, there's no sofa, only a strange kind of low bench, and a very uncomfortable vinyl coated armchair.  There's no separation between the living area and the bedroom, which makes it unsuitable for families with an older child.  The bathroom is frankly perplexing, and not up to the standard you expect for a 5* suite. It is large, and could have easily accommodated a bathtub and a walk-in shower.  Instead there's a pokey budget bath/shower combo with a cheap-looking sliding door, that you have to climb into to use.  Towels are stored on the wall behind the sliding door, so you have to climb into the bath to access them.  This is a space-saving solution that you see in small budget hotels, or in HDBs, and in those locations it makes sense.  But having a Travelodge-style bathroom in a 5* suite is very jarring.  Despite having plenty of space for a double vanity, which is standard in a master bathroom in a suite, there's one small sink that everyone has to share.  For some reason there's also floor to ceiling storage units on both sides of the tiny sink area, which are empty. These would be very helpful in our HDB at home, but are completely useless in a hotel room, where guests are normally staying for only a couple of nights.  We would have overlooked these points if everything else was high quality, but even basic cleanliness was an issue.  The rooms were serviced, but there was poor standards on show, with dirty dishes left in the room after servicing. The corridors are strewn with rubbish and dirty dishes discarded from the hotel's guests, that sit in the corridors for hours, without being cleared.  Housekeeping is clearly not a high priority.  In terms of F&B, there are three restaurants open during the evening. The Sichuan Min Jiang, specialises in shark fin, so if you care about conservation and sustainability, please steer clear. Another is the Coffee Lounge, a basic cafeteria that specialises in durian and has all the olfactory qualities you'd expect from that. The smell is very intense and permeates the whole area around the cafeteria, so you'd need to be a big fan of durian to brave that one.  The last one, Gordon Grill, has a limited menu which looks like something you would have found in a faux-French restaurant in a quaint English town in the 1970s.    We wouldn't worry about a lot of these things in a budget hotel, like an Ibis or a Travelodge, but if you're paying over $600 a night, we did expect better.    Overall the impression is of a hotel that is dated, tired and old-fashioned, not a a luxury heritage establishment.  I wouldn't stay here again.\u2026",

I was very surprised when a staff showed up with a slice of cake, candle and matches shortly after we returned to our hotel room after our evening walk. Indeed my comments were read !   I also want to compliment the hotel on the homely feel that the staff (many whom are more elderly) gave. They carried out their work well while making me feel like I\u2019m staying at an elderly relative\u2019s house than hotel.

The slight issue that we faced was that the tv in the bedroom was not facing the bed but facing the window. So, if you are laying on the bed, you would not be able to enjoy the tv programs (please see photo). Nonetheless, wasn't a major issue.   Staff were friendly and good selection of local breakfast. ",

Most tables were reserved (as for reason it is a favourite for tea with people) but we were sat at one that was not waiting for our cake order to arrive. We were so rudely moved out of it by a waiter who told us it, too, was reserved. When I pointed there was no sign, he said that a sign on an adjacent table applied to this table as well!!!

This is not the kind of service I expect of Park Hotel. The sender (big guy from restaurant probably) sounded arrogant during delivery and expect things to be in order when it's not. Missing 2 tea spoon for my dessert.  Overall, while I like the hotel snd service at front desk, the rest of the crew is quite a disappointment..

I appreciate you coming early for check in.\u201d I was surprised by her response. She complimented me  without me complimenting her first or expecting a compliment from a guest. At first I was puzzled by her response, but later on, I learned that there was a very long queue of people waiting to check in. So, I did not have to wait long.

Not a big deal as a quick call for housekeeping resolved this issue rather quickly. The best part of this stay had to be the pool. It was huge (by hotel standards) and suitable for lap swimming. The pool area was also pretty. Loved those pillars around the pool. I think they are Roman inspired. Really contributes to the aesthetics of the place.  However, not everything was perfect about the stay. The most glaring negative was the breakfast. Each guest was entitled to only one set. Absolutely no refills apart from drinks were allowed. This came as a surprise to me. There wasn\u2019t even a break basket, fruit or yoghurt. The egg set I had was miserable looking. To\u2026",

You don\u2019t have to stand with this new normal situation. All will be delivered at your table. Upon entry at the Lime restaurant, welcome greet is expected,and you will be brought to your desired seat.  Facilities are far unique among other places. The pool is defined with a unique architecture of bird cage like design. The pool is good to depict am infinity connection to the city horizon. There is a jacuzzi beside the lap pool. There is a patio on the right-side upon exiting the 5th floor lift lobby while the pool is on the left. The hotel in my own word is the hybrid concept of modern and environmental ecology so you won\u2019t feel the bustle of life in the city.",

Both activities did not take place despite confirmation via email prior to the dates, as well as during check in. We were told that the mixologist did not turn up when we reported for the activity at the lime bar at 3pm and were offered a glass of wine as an apology. The garden tour was worse - we received a confirmation call at about 10+am confirming the tour scheduled for 11.30am and to meet at level 5. We reached before 11.30am and waited till 11.45am. There was no staff deployed to conduct the tour. There was an ROM ceremony and when my husband tried to enter the garden next to where the ROM ceremony was held to check if there was any staff conduct the tour, he was abruptly stopped by a not so polite staff who told him to wait till the ceremony was over. What kind of customer service is this? I hope the hotel management will look into this and not provide empty promises that could not be fulfilled.\u2026",

The fantastic location of the hotel. However, I had a very strange experience with the One Connect service person on duty on 27Mar (Sat) around 4pm. I called to inform that I do not need housekeeping for my 3 day stay. I was told, please call back tomorrow as she has no way to notify. I was like \u2018fine, then can I have r extra towels\u2019? The operator asked \u2018how many?\u2019. I said 3. She said \u2018how many people is staying in the room?\u2019. Me \u20182\u2019. She replied \u2018hmm... you need that many??\u2019. Me \u2018well, it\u2019s for 3 days and I do not want housekeeping and there\u2019s only 2 towels in the room now\u2019. I didn\u2019t see a need to explain that my wife and I run every morning so we take more showers then the usual hotel guest. Because why do I need to? Should she just respond with \u2018sure, I will arrange that and is there anything I can help you with?\u2019 I don\u2019t believe this is due to lack of training . It\u2019s an attitude problem. This operator must be too lazy to do her job , or she is probably serving her last day of resignation notice. Still, one bad employee didn\u2019t spoil the good work of the others. This is still a very good stay part from this truly unique experience I had with this One Connect operator .\u2026",

Queued until 6pm and I was not even close to the concierge. Thereafter, I managed to get hold of this staff standing around by the name of Norman. He checked and told us that our room is not ready, he paid me lip service that he will expedite it to be ready in 30min and we will get a call from him. We went to the garden and waited until 7.30pm.

One room was complimentary as part of the Healthcare HERO program while we paid for an additional room.  My advise to families with young children  1. Avoid these rooms as they located along a narrow corridor with short metal poles along it (see photo). This can be dangerous for children who may try to climb over the poles.  2. The condition of room 915 was poor (see photo on bathtub and washbasin). The washbasin has multiple brownish stains and looks disgusting. This was highlighted for the duty manager who eventually came back to confirm that it\u2019s a permanent stain. That\u2019s it - no offer to change room or what so ever -\u2026",

Was checked in by Jacqueline and she breezed thru my registration and even chatted with my kids. I can see other front desk staff smiling and accommodating to the guests despite the long queue!  Was given a room on the 17th floor with a great view of the city. Room was very comfortable. I had no issues with the WIFI and aircon was good and strong. Kids loved the bathtub and this compensated when we did not get slots for the swimming pool.  Breakfast was included in our room rate and we gave it a try the next day. Due to safety measures, no buffet breakfast here. Guest orders were taken, food were served and drinks were refilled. Guests did not need to leave the seats! All were well taken care of! Lyn served us for both days and she remembered our orders the next day. Kudos to her! Ryan also was helpful getting my kids refills (kids being kids).  So a big THANK YOU to Carlton Hotel Bras Basah for making the March Holidays enjoyable! Especially to my kids! Well worth the price paid and not too far off from Suntec should you need to walk to purchase food etc. Thumbs up to the staff for a job well done!\u2026",

Hotel is near to malls like Raffles city, Chimes, Capitol and Funan hence no lack of entertainment and food once venture out. breakfast set provided was great and filling. need to complement all Mosaic cafe servers on their warm services and friendliness on both morning we encountered, unlike the lukewarm check in staff. do not recommend mainly cos of unfriendly attitude of staff, housekeeping of room nt thoroughly, as well as not fulfilling the late check out and room upgrade proactively as per package purchased.

Nice and comfy. Take note toilet with bathtubs the blinds are outside the toilet not inside means can easily open. Would be good if next to the toilet seat to have a water spray. Aircon was brrrrrr.... cold but Kudos to the technician and housekeeping staff they came very promptly when assistance was needed. As it was raining season, the pool water was abit cold. Dont expect olympic size pool, small but can swim. Overall nice family staycay to eat, relax and walk around as the location is very good and accessible. Since we are still in COVID-19 season, if we all manage our expectations abit not that lower expectations\u2026",

Relatively expensive compared to other hotels, at around $250 SGD for the night (no breakfast) and booked on hotels.com. We requested and were allocated a room at the end of the corridor with a view out over Bras Basah complex. Room was very quiet: not much in the way of disturbances from neighbour noise or outside noise/traffic. 30sqm sized room was fine for this length of stay and is on the larger side of typical Singapore city hotel rooms. Comfortable king size bed. Large bathroom with separate shower and bath, rain shower. Very clean. 2 small bottles of water provided free. TV a little small but worked ok. Small pool on level 5 (didn't use). Efficient checkin and checkout (not too many people in October). Good\u2026",

For work there is uninterrupted high speed WIFI, a nice spacious desk and chair with a lovely City view, and as a bonus there is a view of the Cathedral for a reminder of the spiritual.

From the moment we checked in, to the services provided by Housekeeping, help rendered by the in-house Technician, the experience was really top notch and all I can said is that it was an awesome experience throughout.  Shout out to especially Zakiah (front desk) & Justin (Housekeeping).  You guys are really great!!!   Keep up the good work!!!",

                "review_text": "Rate:4.8/5 Price:$$$ Awesome stay @caprisingapore   Capri by Fraser is located in Changi Business Park. It is a new hospitality concept designed to meet the evolving needs of today\u2019s E-generation traveler.  We arrived very early in the morning, with the intention to leave our bags at the concierge and head off to Pulau Ubin. We were greeted by Mas, a very friendly concierge staff. After taking our temperature, we headed to the check-in counter. We met Fherzana, a very amiable and customer-centric staff. The usual check-in is at 4pm but Zana said she would try her best to arrange at 2pm. Then she went through the different hotel facilities and explained to us booking would be required due to Covid-19. She took the initiative to check with us and arranged a slot for the pool, steam room etc, as she told us the bookings usually run out fast. In the midst of all these, she told us that she would upgrade our rooms to deluxe studios, as the rooms we have booked were not available. And all these were done quite swiftly.   When we returned around 130pm, we were surprised that one of our rooms was ready to check-in. Zana told us she will try to get ready the other room, which was ready around 230pm.   As you can see from the photos, the room is spacious. There is a small kitchenette area to do simple cooking. And guess what we did for breakfast? My next post!  I loved the selection of the toiletries. The bed linen was soft and the pillow firmness was just right for me.   There is a good size gym which I didn\u2019t get to use it. The swimming pool water was warm, I think it was due to the warm weather that day. The sauna and steam room were good and clean. There is a \u201cspin & play\u201c room on every floor, where you could do your laundry and enjoy some games like Kinect for #xbox360 or a good massage by #ogawa massage chair.   During our checkout, we were again greeted by Zana and Mas. where Zana came to where we were seated and just to ensure our stay was good. We praised her for her professionalism.   Capri is a perfect getaway to rekindle the special connection with your partner and friends, or just wanting to have the \u201cme time\u201d vacation.\u2026",

The room is spacious and clean. Well decorated for the occasion & given a sweet treat. We took the Masterchef package with steak as main menu. The recipe is pretty easy to follow, just that it can be improved by labelling the containers of each ingredient to avoid confusion. Another minus point, we think the microwave doesn\u2019t work well to heat the food (not sure if it is spoilt or we operated it incorrectly). Oh, we also love the massage chair here!! Looking forward to swimming time tomorrow. Overall, we are happy with our 1 night staycation. Thank you all staffs in Capri by Fraser! All of you have done a good job! Keep it up!",

They did not take the initiative to inform us on the new procedure of not providing complimentary tickets. When questioned about the recent change, they were dismissive and just defensive claiming that it is not on them since it has been featured on the booking website. They then just referred our case to the manager, who happened to be nice and apologetic but by then, emotions were high and the damage is done. We also had to be charged for a parking fee of 20-odd dollars which could have been avoided if they had notified us upon checking in. Moving forth, the check in time was also an issue for us. They issued us a late check in\u2026",

The room was spacious and very clean. There\u2019s a pleasant smell to the room which is very inviting. And to book the pool is very easy, I simply need to scan the QR code beside my bed and It direct me to Lola, a chat bot which help to secure my booking.   Overall i am very satisfied with my stay. Awesome job to Han the rest of the team! Keep it up:)",

I received a call from their rep, Say Hui saying that my booking need to be cancelled due to some unforeseen circumstances. Of course, I made her life difficult. I called and insisted that she did something that would be feasible to me. I gave her a really rough time. What was applaudable was she tried her very best to give me a room. I would like to thank her for making it happen as I promised my children the long awaited staycation.  I came and checked in. It was easy breezy. I was attended by the same cheerful and bubbly, Zakiah Hanim. The first rep I met during my first visit. She informed me that our room was being upgraded and yes there was a bath tub for me. \ud83d\udc4d what a\u2026",

Many thanks to the hotel to accommodate our request for adjoining rooms, the early check-in, and the birthday surprise delivered by Yolanda.  Many thanks also to Eswari and Aldrina for the patience shown in clarifying the parking charges. S$21.40 for a single-use exit pass regardless of the number of hours/days stayed.   The location of this hotel is very good. There are many big shopping malls and food establishments right beside it. The MRT is very nearby too.   The room layout is somewhat unconventional with the bathroom located right against the exterior windows. This means guests have to choose between privacy or good view and natural light.  It also means lots of curtains up/down. It will take some getting used to by some.  Our family has enjoyed our staycation with this hotel. Despite the abovementioned layout, the rooms are very cozy.   The Komyuniti Restaurant located at Level 10 is a good place to dine in also. It is doing relatively well despite the many Covid-19 restrictions in place. Their prices are reasonable. \u2026",

We had a high floor hence we had a good view of the orchard area surroundings. However, I think the design of the room is very bad/not soundproof as I could hear water flushing down the pipe whenever the guests above uses the toilet/bathe. It happened in the day and we thought nothing of it. However, we didn\u2019t realised how loud it was that we got awaken up at 3am by the water flowing through the pipes and it lasted about an hour! (Like who bathes at 3am?!)  We called the guest services and the technician came down to explain they couldn\u2019t do anything about it but thankfully enough they allowed us to have a late checkout since it\u2026",

The premium queen room is relatively snug with not much space to sit down and have a meal in the room. The design of the room is slightly awkward as the window is in the bathroom. Hence , the blinds had to be wind up and down before and after usage of the bathroom. The sink is right next to the bed , might not be the best if you are not staying alone and your partner is a light sleeper. There is no proper table or space to be used to sit down and have a meal together in the room. Breakfast is average but still decent , with savoury and sweet options offered.

Check in time is 3pm but I reached the hotel at 11am and planned to leave my bags there with the concierge first as  we had some brunch plans and planned to come back at 3pm. However the Receptionist, (Vanessa I think? Guest Service Supervisor.) allowed me a complimentary early check in, which was kind of her!  When we first stepped into the room, we were impressed by the cleanliness of the room! Except for a bit of tape that was left on a really high part of the wall (I guess the previous guest pasted some decorations for a party or celebration?) which would have been hard to notice anyway, everything else was thoroughly clean and you could tell the room furniture and appliances were well-maintained too! Room was prepared by Housekeeping staff named Leong. Although we didn\u2019t get to meet him, he definitely left a great impression to us. The Housekeeping team must be proud to have him in their team!  The Concierge Team were always helpful and friendly! Glenn helped with our luggage upon our departure, he was cheerful and pleasant. There was another Concierge staff, I didn\u2019t manage to get his name, but he was an Indian man, who was also very friendly to all the guests! You can tell he was well-liked by the residents too because I noticed they were all happy to see him every morning. The receptionist who attended to me at check out (Mikaela, I think?) from the Reception team was also very pleasant and full of smiles.   Room was spacious! Beds were comfortable and I love that the bathroom had both ceiling rain shower and a freestanding tub! I normally don\u2019t bother to get into bathtubs in hotels but I couldn\u2019t say no to soaking and relaxing in a nice deep freestanding tub.   Breakfast was not that impressive but that didn\u2019t dampen our stay. Definitely had an enjoyable staycation and I foresee my husband and I returning to Ascott Orchard for future staycations!  \u2026",

Kitchenette was basic and functional, made a lovely dinner during our stay. Could have asked for more kitchen towels to ease up with the cleaning and drying of dishes.

Room service is there but some things we can take care of it ourselves. The dining table wasn't too clean. These are just some minor things. I'm normally very fussy but this place is really nice.....

This hotel is tucked away from the main drag of Orchard Road, but is ever so convenient 3-5 min walk to MTR and bus stations. Located between Somerset and Orchard MTR stations it gives you tons of options in traveling and seeing Singapore. Food courts and restaurants are literally down the street. If luxury shopping is your thing, designer shops line Orchard Rd on both sides so shop away. Staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. The hotel is connected via sky bridge to Paragon but the sky bridge takes a little work to get to as it's accessible via parking garage or a short walk past the pool area.",

Two MRT stations close by which makes it convenient if you want to use the MRT or Grab. I booked 2 x deluxe rooms for 4 days.  I gave the room a 3 star as there was no power sockets at the bed side tables. This means we had to use the spare gpo at the work desk and also unplug the lamp sitting on the work desk. Also, where the kettle is positioned, the cable length of the kettle doesn't reach the gpo provided near the floor. We had to move the kettle to the work desk and use the gpo there.

                "review_text": "Most people have talked about Lloyd\u2019s Inn Singapore since her renovation. Photos and reviews were seen on #instagram and social media. So is Lloyd\u2019s Inn really what you have seen and read? Let me share some of my personal experiences.   Lloyd\u2019s Inn Singapore is not like any other big hotels. It has her charms - a mixture of quaint and modern minimalist contemporary design. It is also known as a boutique hotel, with an oasis in mind in the city\u2019s center.   As you entered the main entrance, you would walk across an elevated bridge, with a bird\u2019s eye view to the surrounding common areas - a small square size garden with swings, a very narrow dipping pool, and some shaded nooks and crannies where one could relax and read - before reaching the hotel lobby.   Lloyd\u2019s Inn has different types of rooms available. I opted for the \u201cgarden room\u201d which was a tier above the standard room because of the beautiful photos displayed on their website. When I entered the room which was on the ground level, the room was a bit smaller, which was expected. I was eagerly looking for the swing in the garden, where I could take some #instagramable photos, but to my dismay, the garden was just a tiny small patch of space. My inspiration to take beautiful photos was completely destroyed. However I loved the bathroom (which was not really well taken, as you could see from photo#6 due to the disappointment), it was partially indoors with an open outdoor concept, giving you some privacy and closed to nature.   I felt a bit \u201ccheated\u201d with the fact that I have paid a bit higher to get the type of room I wanted. So I decided to go to the concierge to check with the staff. The staff were friendly but not too professional. I explained to one of them, telling him the room configuration was not the same as in their website, and all he said was \u201cI am sorry because the room has been taken\u201d, cos there is only 1 such room. Why did Lloyd\u2019s Inn put that photo in their website if there is only 1 room? Or at least to state clearly in the website that there is only 1 such room! I returned to the room frustrated.   Another disappointment: I indicated that I would like to have a queen size bed during my booking. My bed looked like one but I realized it was joined together from 2 single beds. Come on! This is not a budget hotel! With the premium price that I have paid, I could not even get a decent queen size bed? To add salt to the wounds, during check-in, the staff at the concierge reiterated my request during the check in. If she would tell me that the bed I would be getting were 2 joined-single beds, at least my heart was prepared. The whole experience really spoilt my dream #staycationsg   Talking about #customercentricity and #transparency these days... #lloydsinnsingapore has much to learn.   Well I was determined not to be spoilt by these experiences. So I explored around the area for eateries \ud83c\udf72 \ud83c\udf71 \ud83e\udd58.   Indeed one is spoilt with choices - from local coffee shops to restaurants, a wide selection! Whether it\u2019s comfort food from Killiney Kopitiam, or Hong Kong Tim Sum by So Good Char Chang Ting, there will definitely one that will suit you. Other choices will be like Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Western etc. Look out for my food reviews to some of these places I have visited next week.   Lloyd\u2019s Inn comes with a simple breakfast set, in collaboration with ABC, Artisan Boulangerie Co. as they don\u2019t have a kitchen or restaurant in the hotel. They do have an outdoor seating areas where you can #grabfoodsg and enjoy the alfresco dining.   Overall, a very unique experience. Would I be back again? Hmmmf, I would think twice with the same amount for a hotel that know how to appreciate their guests. \u2026",

I am glad I booked a garden room as it\u2019s bigger and has outdoor space - something like a balcony if you would like. The shower also is under the canopy of trees. If you like exclusivity, greenery and quaintness this inn will serve you well. I feel it\u2019s more for couples and solo travellers, not so good for the family. First and foremost there\u2019s no proper swimming pool, just a wading pool and the lack of dining facilities onsite is a killer. Breakfast vouchers are giving to go to a nearby cafe for a hot drink and a pastry. But my main qualm is there\u2019s no sound proofing system. I was awakened on both nights, first day by people showering, second day by the heavy rain. So, if you are looking for a good sleep you may want to consider this. Other than that, the hotel room is clean and I like the minimalist concept and concrete floor. Not much to complain of. \u2026",

Firstly, for both nights we stayed there, we smelt smoke through the ventilation system. It was super uncomfortable and frustrating to be breathing in smoke while trying to sleep.  Secondly, the doors do not close silently... they slam hard when you leave or enter the room. The place is generally echoey, and I can imagine many people staying there would hang out late in Town.

There's a lot of natural light, green plants and keeping its minimalist essence. The furnishing are well maintained,  room was also clean. Every bit was Instagram worthy!

I am rating this as one of the best staycations I had in Singapore.   True enough the rooms are small, nothing much to mention, nothing on the extra ordinary. That said, my title for this review. You'll love how this hotel is so simple yet comfortable and has its own characteristics. It's simply the heaven for minimalist. Can't wait to try the other rooms that comes with a big tub.   I book the Reading Room. Despite the room size which is small, expect quality beddings and you gotta love the bathroom.

In terms of comfort, the hotel just offers basics, but all the necessary basics are there - including umbrellas to use in case of rain, and a pool which is too shallow to really swim but enough to cool off on a hot afternoon.

Their first breakfast option doesn\u2019t appeal to us as its in an overheated open busy Asian styled breakfast cafe so we had to buy breakfast elsewhere each day even though we payed for breakfast as part of this, so that did not go down well with me.

Service was poor as well because I repeatedly called room service, concierge and operator, basically every available number, at 10pm to ask for a bucket of ice but nobody answered the calls. I gave up calling at 10.40pm and went to the front desk myself, only to be told that room service ceased at 10.30pm. Where were you from 10pm to 10.30pm?",

Only 2 bath towels and 1 toothbrush set were supplied. We had to remind them to supply us with bottled water. They were\u2026",

My room had only one bath towel and no laundry bag provided . My kids\u2019 bathroom had no shower curtain and floor mat. However, the housekeeping staff was fast to respond and rectify when I called. As we had booked club benefit rooms, we were able to have afternoon tea at Mitzo and also evening cocktails.

However, due to the hotel being used for SHN instead, we were given a choice of going for the Nuve heritage or Park Royal pickering. We chose this hotel because of location. The room was fine. However, i would think an upgrading of the room is necessary. Room was a suite at level 6 and was the only room at that level.  The artist suite is the only room with an outdoor balcony. Which was nice. However, toilet tiles were stained yellow. Under the bed, there were a couple of used tissues when we entered. I would think during this covid era, proper housekeeping is highly important.   Electric kettle was dirty with obvious brown stains inside. And the dolce gusto machine, water compartment was yellow and pretty stained. It was rectified when we came back thanks to Joel quick response.  After our first night, housekeeping came and did the basic clean up. But a little confused on why a pile of towels were left behind instead of being cleared away.   Apart from all this little areas that needs improvement, the only thing that deserves a mention is Joel. He checked us in swiftly and was very patient in listening and attending to our needs. Always greeting us each time we walk by. He's a gem in your hotel and we hope you send this msg to him! Thank you Joel!  \u2026",

However, they have us 2 towels; 1 with an obvious strain on it and the other towel is town and looks like a rag cloth.   We called the room service to replace new towels and they did quickly and apologies for the unpleasant experience. Apart from that, the light switch is confusing.

However, the staff were helpful and tried to solve it by changing the batteries. This did not solve the problem though. I think there is a sensor problem since it seems to work when we closed the toilet lid. That was a bit of a downer as we were excited to use it. The room was generally clean but there were quite a lot of ants whenever we had some coffee or snacks in the room. Room was generally quiet except for some car horn sounds along Prinsep. I would like to commend Joel for his attentiveness during our stay such as helping to keep our cake in the restaurant fridge and even answering all my queries promptly prior to the visit.   What really ruined my whole experience was at the check-out. I was asked to pay for a towel that had yellow stains by a female staff at the front desk. Since I had not seen that stain in my stay, I asked the staff about where it was and what it was stained by. The lady staff on-duty replied very condescendingly. I kept telling her I did not see that stain in any of the towels I used and she kept saying all the towels provided in the rooms were unstained so if it is stained it must be from our use.  I asked to look at where the towel was found and the staff brought me back to the room. I was told that the towel was found in a pile on the floor at the foot of the bed between the bed and night stand. My partner recalled using that towel the night before for a bath and it did not look stained. (None of the bath robes or other towels we used got stained so I do not think it was due to any of our bath products as well) It was still wet when he put it on the floor and I think it might have gotten stained from some dirt on the floor/ bottom of the bed or nightstand since it was still wet.   However, I was given no grace from this staff. In the end she did not charge me the extra charges but kept saying how she had the right to charge me and she was doing me this huge favor. I felt extremely disrespected by her attitude. Considering I also saw blood stains on the bedsheet but thought it was a minor issue and did not raise it up, I don't know why the staff are not able to provide some grace and magnanimity in this situation.\u2026",

It was mainly due to the proximity to Suntec and the fact that the online photos looked nice.  I arrived at night so didn't really notice the hotel location until the next morning. It looked like a really nice small street with restaurants, cafes and bars and interesting shops as well. Too bad I didn't have time to explore. Perhaps next time.  The room I had was small. Reminded me of rooms I had in Paris hotels. So, if you're going to stay here, you'll need to manage your expectations. The stay was comfortable. I really liked the free mini bar. It's a totally new experience for me. The shower was good too. Nicer than some at the other Singapore hotels I've stayed\u2026",

Boutique hotel, so don't look for amenities like gym, pool etc. The room was clean and compact. Good wifi, snacks on the ground floor. Decent breakfast buffet till 10am. But there are tons of great places for dinner, just even on that street alone. Expected it to be noisy, but was surprisingly quiet. Highly enjoyed my stay and recommend it for a couple enjoying being near the city attractions and shopping!",

Very friendly and helpful.    My one and only small complaint would be the lack of a full-length mirror which could easily be fitted to the inside of the wardrobe door.    As a reguar visitor to Singapore, but one who has always tried a new Hotel on each visit, I have already booked to go back.  Thanks guys.  It was a pleasure!",

The highlights were: - excellent and friendly front desk staff; do this well, and many other things can be overlooked. - stylishly designed rooms, clean and comfortable. - well located; being on Purvis Street there are plenty of options for eating, and a relatively close to many other attractions. - Thanks for the early checking - that was appreciated! - The free minibar is an excellent innovation. It's not loaded with stuff, but we did not even get through half of what was in there.  However, being in Singapore, and in an older style building, the room was quite small. Organise yourself well, and it's not a problem.",

The other bonus being that the mini bar (including snacks and beer) is free for every guest!  There is a 7/11 around the corner which is useful for amenities.

There\u2019s space under the bed for luggage, and enough room for a small table for working travellers. Rooms feel quite well-maintained. Checkin and out was fast and efficient.

You have several vending machines and you can walk it down bencooleen for a late night drink... You also have Gokul which is an Indian restaurant across the street.

Duty manager, Daryl Goh attended to us at check-in was approachable and friendly in demeanour. He was knowledgeable, meticulous and systemic in the check-in process and safety checks. The expedient and systemic check-in process facilitated concurrency of activities and minimised waiting time for guests, and the build-up of any queue at all.   Not the first time a staying at Hotel G and I must say Hotel G\u2019s rooms are consistently clean and well maintained. Staff are proactive and helpful, and it\u2019s always a comfortable experience!   p.s. Do book with the current burgers in bed promo which is amazing!",

A kettle with complimentary coffee/tea bags on a tiny desktop leaves no space to place your personal accessories like phones, jewellery, etc.  Breakfast is the standard western fare or chicken congee, with a cup of cut fruits and croissants. Service is efficient, though you have to ask for butter if you want it with your croissants.  Hotel G is a conveniently located near to MRT stations Rochor/Bencoolen.

Room's bathroom has excellent water pressure and soap smells so good!  We also loved how the tv has chrome cast so we can stream YouTube on it for some karaoke haha!  One downside was that the mattress was a little uncomfortable, it was a tad too soft for my liking.   Other than that, we absolutely loved our stay at yotel air! ",

I've spent plenty of nights at this airport, watching midnight movies, or snoozing in one of the nap rooms. But during my last trip, due to Covid concerns I decided to hunker down in privacy for my 16 hour layover. YOTELAIR did not disappoint. It definitely didn't give hotel vibes upon arrival, but no matter. What I paid for was the bed, and what a bed it was! It was adjustable in every possible permutation I could imagine, which was handy since it was just about the only piece of furniture in the room. The room itself could fit into a bathroom in a Marina Bay Sands suite, which makes it all the more remarkable how much they manage to fit\u2026",

The luggage capacity can be limited if you have allot. We had only normal and that went just fine. Can recommend it as a nice place to spend your time for a stop-over stay. Will for sure try out the concept other places.",

They say it's a 9am checkout, but they gave us 2 extra hours because we got in so late.  The room is very clean but tiny.  Basically it\u2019s a queen bed with a small walk space beside it and a bathroom behind.  It was perfect for what we wanted.  Just a place to sleep.",

                "review_text": "Very tired it's now 4am, we landed in Singapore at 230am. Booked the Yotel air hotel, Singapore airport for the 14/15 Jan. The reception had us down for the 15/16 Jan. We booked thru Agoda reservation#445632169.  The manager told us it was a glitch in Agoda's system. However since we are stranded with two young kids at 4am in the lobby we had the privilege of watching the manager sell another story to another family. They too have been told their reservation is unavailable due to a glitch! So it would seem it's not Agoda but Yotel with an internal problem.  The manager was hoping we would walk and try and sort it out with Agoda.  Please note it's not an easy task to get a hold of Agoda when the booking goes wrong.  We have fully paid for this room well in advance.  I asked the\u2026",

                "review_text": "We stayed in a family room and it was small (as expected) but had everything we needed for a one night stay.   The biggest issue for us was the inability to sleep due to the noise from the adjoining room and the hallway. We could hear every time someone walked past - which is a lot in an airport-based hotel!   Also, I see another reviewer mentioned that the bedding for adults was more substantial than for the kids. This makes it very difficult to set a temperature for everyone to enjoy. Looks like the child bedding was best, as the room never actually got very cool even when set at 21 degrees.   While the beds were comfy, the room clean and the location good, I can't rate this hotel any higher as we left exhausted from a poor night's sleep.",

I had no idea when I booked this that it would be just a cabin, I would have stayed across the road in a proper hotel, Breakfast was at 6.30 and we had to leave, they still deemed it necessary to charge me $40.00 plus for nothing.   DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!",
